Sarah looked up high. She could see the scissors up on top of the cabinet. If she could only reach them, she could cut the gum out of her baby sister's hair and her mom would never know. Her mom was still busy helping her brother take out the trash. Sarah quickly pushed a chair over to the cabinet. She climbed up on the chair and got the scissors. Then she hopped down and put the chair back at the table. Sarah ran to the bathroom and shut the door. While her sister sat on the floor, Sarah cut the gum and a big piece of Sally's hair, and then threw it into the trash.  Sarah put on her dress, then she and Sally headed back to the kitchen for breakfast. Sarah had taken a drink of her chocolate milk when she heard her brother Kyle start to laugh and point at Sally's head. Their mother heard the laugh and turned around to see what was so funny. Sarah began to turn red before their mother even asked what had happened. "I did it," Sarah said in a quiet voice, "I'm sorry, Mom."
