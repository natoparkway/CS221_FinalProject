Alex was right next to his close friend when he heard a strange noise. He was afraid of this noise so he built a shield. From behind the shield, Alex had to shout, "Who is there?" Then he saw an animal that had a green stripe across its back. Alex was scared. Then the animal stepped into a plate filled with frosting and the animal slipped and fell on the ground. Alex had to be quiet so he could get to the out and to the playground without the animal hearing him. After he was far enough away, Alex started to run very fast. He ran and ran until he finally made it to the playground where he hid for the rest of the day in the sand box. When he felt safe he called his mother and had her pick him up and get away. When his mom got there, Alex said, "Thank you for coming to get me mom, I was so scared." His mom told him, "You are very welcome Alex. I'm here whenever you need me."
