One day, Jimmy, who was getting ready to walk down to school, could not find his favorite hat. He began looking all over the place for it, his room, the kitchen, even outside. It was nowhere to be found. He was running late for school and didn't want to be marked absent so he went to school without it. At school, Jimmy kept becoming upset because he couldn't find his hat. When Jimmy got home his hat was sitting there next to his goldfish. His mom had found it. It was in the kitchen the whole time.
