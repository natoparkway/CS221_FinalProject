Ted's Birthday  Ted was feeling happy as he looked into his bedroom mirror. He knew that tomorrow would be his birthday. Ted would be seven years old and his daddy was going to take him somewhere special.  Ted's little brother Paul was playing with his alphabet blocks on the floor. Ted walked over and pat him on the shoulder. "Daddy said he's taking me to the new yogurt store," he told Paul. Paul is four years old so he asked Ted what a yogurt store was. "Yogurt is like ice cream," he told Paul, "and I'm going to get cherry." Paul said that he wanted cherry, too.   Then Ted walked over to the closet. He looked at his favorite shirt and pants to wear tomorrow. Then he looked at his shiny black pair of shoes. He smiled because he would have a nice shirt, pair of pants, and pair of shoes to wear for his birthday.  The two boys then heard the front door open and close. They raced down the stairs to greet their father. "Daddy, I'm ready for my birthday," Ted said. "Me too," said Paul. Their father laughed as he picked them up and carried them upstairs.
