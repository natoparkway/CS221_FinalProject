One day, the mouse, Rudd, got a splinter in his paw when he was putting a new fence around his house. His turtle friend with a weird name, Dig, came up to Rudd after he heard him yelling, "Ouch, I've got a splinter in my paw! Can someone help?" Dig, being the ever helpful turtle, took the splinter in his mouth and tugged it. The splinter popped right out of Rudd's paw and flew right into the air and then landed in the middle of the river.  Rudd looked happy and gave Dig a hug. "Thank you so much, Dig! And for helping me, I'll give you the choice of one of these three desserts I found. What would you like to have? A cake? A cookie? Or maybe this brownie?"  "Oh, Rudd, you are so silly and know you don't even have to ask me which one I'd take. You know I love brownies!" Dig smiled happily as Rudd gave him his treat and another hug for helping with the splinter.  After the two friends finish their dessert, Dig helped Rudd put up the rest of his fence until the sun went down that day. It was a good day for both friends.
