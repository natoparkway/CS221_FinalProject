Today, Anne is hungry. She wants to eat somewhere in town.  There is a popular diner in town. She goes there and asks them if she can get fries and a chocolate milkshake.  Her friends come into the diner and sit with her. Their names are Jane, Jake and Dave. All of them are 15 years old.  Jake gets a big cheeseburger with onions. Jane wants a vanilla ice cream cone with sprinkles. Dave doesn't eat anything. He talks with them instead.  After they finish eating, they go back to Jane's house to hang out and play games. Dave wins most of the puzzle games. Jane beats them at a few. They're racing games.  Dave leaves after an hour. He needs to go do his reading homework. Jake and Anne leave that evening because it's a school night. They all promise to meet up again the next day to hang out after school.
