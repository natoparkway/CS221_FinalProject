There once was an elephant named Ellie.  She really liked to eat peanuts.   She lived with a circus and performed with clowns.  One day she was really hungry and could not find any peanuts.   She asked the lion, "Do you have any peanuts?"  The lion said, "Sorry, I don't like peanuts, but the squirrel may have some."  Ellie went looking for the squirrel and along the way saw a little girl.    The little girl was crying.  Ellie asked the little girl, "Why are you crying?"  The little girl, Ava, said, "I lost my parents!"  The elephant put Ava on her back and said, "I can help you look for them."  They looked high and low for Ava's parents.  Ellie made a loud sound with her nose and Ava's parents came to see what it was!  Her parents were so happy to find Ava and so was Ellie.  Ellie's stomach began to growl and Ava heard it.  She dug into her parent's bag and brought out a bag of peanuts!  Ellie ate the peanuts and everyone lived happily ever after.
