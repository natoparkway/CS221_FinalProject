One Saturday afternoon about the second week of May, Maggie and her mom Jan went to the dentist. Maggie was seven years old and she was scared of the dentist, but her mom promised to fix her favorite chicken dish for dinner if Maggie was a good girl. "At least it's not the doctor's!" she said. They got to the dentist office and Jan told the woman, named Tiffany, at the front desk that they were there. There were lots of toys in the waiting room but Maggie was too nervous to enjoy them like the other kids. Finally, a woman came and told Maggie and Jan that it was Maggie's turn. They made a right turn and went to the third room on the left. Maggie sat down in the dentist's chair. A woman, Mary, came in and cleaned her teeth and told Maggie and Jan that Maggie had done well with her brushing. Then the dentist, Taylor, came in and did a checkup. He saw that everything was good and that Maggie had no problems with her teeth. He gave Maggie a bag with a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a sugar free candy. There was also a smiley face sticker in the bag. Jan was proud of her daughter and stopped at the grocery store to get ingredients for the chicken dish for dinner as promised.
