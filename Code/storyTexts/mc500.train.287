Mabel's aunt wanted to give her the best birthday present ever. So the day after Mabel's birthday, her aunt brought her to the pet store! Mabel had been asking her aunt for a pet for a very long time. Many of her friends had pets, and she wanted one too. Her friend Faith had a hamster named Peaches. Bobby had a rat named Hugo! Melissa had two snakes and a lizard! Heather had a fish bowl with three fish. Mabel couldn't wait to get her pet and tell her friends all about it. At the pet store, Mabel and her aunt looked at all the animals they had. They saw puppies, kittens, fish, turtles, frogs, and bunnies. Mabel saw a cute black puppy that she thought she might like. There was also a white kitten with blue eyes. But then Mabel saw a gray bunny who was fluffy and soft, and she knew that she wanted the bunny as her pet. Her aunt helped her buy the bunny. They also got everything they needed for the bunny. They got a cage, a water bowl, and bunny food. Mabel named her new bunny Fluffy.  Mabel thanked her aunt, and she had the best birthday ever!
