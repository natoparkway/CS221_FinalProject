Charlie woke up from his nap. He had finished eating all the delicious food on the table that Samantha had made for him and he was tired. With a laugh, Charlie looked at the green balloon that his daughter Samantha had put over his head to float. Bobo the dog walked into the room where Charlie was sitting and made a noise. Bobo barked.  \tabCharlie looked at Bobo and smiled, and then grabbed his brown hat from the table. Next to his hat there was a picture of a rainbow that Samantha had drawn for Charlie. It was a pretty rainbow. Chelsea the cat walked in on Bobo with his barking and Charlie with his hat in hand and then meowed. Chelsea and Bobo looked at each other. Charlie, seeing the two looking at each other, made the choice that enough was enough and opened the door to walk outside. Samantha was standing outside the house on the lawn, and with a yell, she surprised Charlie! With a wave of her hand, she showed him the duck that she was watching. Samantha gave the duck the name Wilfred, and Charlie was pleased. He and Samantha watched Wilfred walk away and they saw a real rainbow in the distance. It was a beautiful start to the day. Bluebird the blue bird was flying high in the sky, and Charlie smiled. In the distance, he saw a white airplane.
