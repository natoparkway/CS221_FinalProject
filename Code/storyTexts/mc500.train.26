Jill ran upstairs as soon as she got home from school. Today she was a sad and angry girl. Her teacher had given her a lot of homework. Jill always thought homework wasn't fair. But she thought it was extra unfair today because she wanted to play with a new toy. The new toy was called Wiggle Giggle and Jill's friends said it was very fun. When Jill ran into her room, she jumped up on her bed. Frowning, she tried to think of a way to get her homework done very quickly. While she was thinking, she unwrapped a brownie and began to eat it. Brownies were her favorite snack and it made her feel a little better. Suddenly, Jill came up with a plan. She jumped down from the bed and stuffed the rest of the snack in her mouth. As she chewed, she opened her toy chest. Jill had to dig way down to the bottom, but she soon found what she was looking for: parts from a few broken toys. Things were looking up! Jill's plan was to build a robot to do her homework. Nothing would get in the way of her plan. It took her hours to finish it, but she was proud of her work. When it was done, she named the robot Mister Sparks. She told it, "Mister Sparks, do my homework!" Then Jill had to go eat dinner. After dinner, Jill spent the rest of the night playing Wiggle Giggle. It was so much fun! But Jill got some bad news before going to bed. Mister Sparks had not done any of the homework!
