A family of four went to the zoo today.  The animal zoo they were going to had a bunch of different kinds of animals!  The kids were so excited to go that they had almost forgot to bring their camera.  They arrived to the zoo and the first thing they saw were the flamingos!  They were so pretty and pink.  They all stood around very silently and looked at the people.  The next animal they saw were the lions.  They were so scary looking that the kids were scared to walk close to the fence. After the lions were the giraffes.  They were so tall, the kids had to lean all the way back to see them.  The kids were hungry so they went to go eat lunch.  The family had a bunch of food such as pizza, burgers, chicken fingers, and fries. After lunch, they went to see the monkeys.  They were so loud and smelly.  Some of the monkeys went right up to the glass to look at the people.  The family took a break after seeing the monkeys as they were tired from all the walking.  The park was so big that they had so many more animals to see!  Their feet started hurting, so the family went to see a few more animals.  They went home after a really fun day at the zoo.  They had seen a lot of animals they never would have seen outside of the zoo.  They loved the zoo so much they wanted to go back next week!  The parents said they would come back soon to see how the animals were doing.
