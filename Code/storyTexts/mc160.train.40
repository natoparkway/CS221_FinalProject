Once upon a time there were three rabbits, named Winston, Chester, and Francis. Chester was a brown rabbit with large eyes. Francis was grey and white and had messy fur. Winston was black and very fat. They were very happy rabbits who loved to eat. Every day they would leave their home, cross a road, and go through a small forest to get to a meadow of grass. They loved to eat that grass. One day, Chester thought he smelled something interesting. At first he thought it might be dirt. Then he thought maybe some sort of flower. So, he asked a nearby squirrel. The squirrel's name was Acorn. Acorn said that he thought it was mushrooms. However, Francis, the smartest rabbit, went to go look, and he learned that it was actually a garden of carrots. The rabbits were all excited. They all loved carrots! They ate all the carrots.
