Cindy and Mary were playing at recess. They were having a great time until Cindy brought up Allison's birthday party. Cindy had been invited to it, but Mary had not. This hurt Mary's feelings a lot. The girls kept on playing and Mary was trying to have fun, but all she felt like doing was crying. She couldn't believe that she had not been invited to Allison's birthday party. She thought that they were friends and if her best friend Cindy had been invited, why not her?  After recess was over, the class walked back into the school. Mary saw Allison in line and tried to smile, but it was hard. Cindy felt horrible now that she had talked about the party that her friend was not going to.  Mary found it hard to pay attention to the teacher now. She kept thinking over and over why Allison didn't invite her to the party. Did Mary do something to make Allison mad or to hurt her? She couldn't understand it. Her eyes started to get wet with tears. She was hoping that no one saw this. Mary thought she saw Allison looking at her in a funny way. Suddenly Mary felt like she was going to start crying. She reached into her desk to pull out some tissues. She felt a strange  piece of paper. She pulled it out and there was the invitation to Allison's party. It had gotten mixed up in her papers in her desk. She immediately started to smile. She smiled at Allison and at Cindy. Cindy gave her a puzzled look because she thought that Mary was sad.   At lunch Mary explained everything to Cindy. Then Mary, Allison, and Cindy all went off to play.
