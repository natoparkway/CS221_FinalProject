This story takes place in a faraway land.  One day, in this magical kingdom a happy little kitten, named Lucy, was walking down the road.  As she turned the corner, she came upon a frog who had badly hurt his leg trying to jump over a puddle.  The kitten looked down at the frog and asked him if he needed any help.  The frog said, "Oh, yes.  My name is Sammy.  I'm late for a very important meeting with my father, Ralph.  I was trying to jump over this puddle and caught my leg on that rock."  The kitten bent down and helped the frog climb on to her back.  She carried the frog all the way in to the city, to the place where he was to meet his father.  When the kitten entered the great room with the frog on her back, all of the frogs that were inside looked on in fear.  The frog quickly explained to them how kind and brave the young kitten had been in helping him make it to his meeting.  As it turned out, the frog was actually a prince and today was the day that his father was to pass rule on to him.  In reward for helping him, the new frog king made the kitten a princess, and they lived happily ever after as the best of friends.
