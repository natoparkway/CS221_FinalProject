Once upon a time, there was a dog named Puddles. Puddles was lonely because he lived in an area where there were no other dogs, but only cats. Day after day, Puddles would have to eat cat food and do cat things in order to fit in with the rest of his group. He found it very boring and Puddles was sad. Puddles didn't even look like a cat!  All of the other cats teased Puddles. "You're too big," they said. "You've got too long of a nose!" "Why are you panting like that?" Puddles knew that he was different.  One day, Puddles chose to run away from all of the cats. The cats laughed at him. What a stupid dog! Didn't he know that there were monsters in the woods that could eat him? Puddles didn't care, because Puddles was sad enough to try.  So Puddles packed up his things - his squeaky ball, his water dish, and his bone - and headed off into the woods. He was finally happy! All of a sudden, Puddles turned. He smelled a funny smell. It smelled like something he had never smelled before. He turned around, and what did he see but another dog!  Puddles was so happy, he barked with joy. He went home with the other dog, who was named Mittens, and to his family. Puddles was never lonely again.
