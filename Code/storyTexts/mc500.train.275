Randy was a boy who loved to eat spaghetti. One day he met a girl named Hilda. People said that Hilda made the best spaghetti in the world. So Randy wanted to try some of Hilda's spaghetti. He asked Hilda, "Hilda, would you make me some spaghetti please?" Hilda said, "Sure! Just come to my house tomorrow!" So the next day Randy went to Hilda's house, sat down in the dining room, and waited.  Then Hilda came out with a big plate of spaghetti with spinach soup. The only problem was that the spaghetti was bright blue. Randy said, "This spaghetti is blue! The soup is blue also! I hate the color blue and I won't eat any blue food!" This made Hilda sad, and she started to cry. This made Randy feel bad so he said, "It's okay, Hilda. Don't cry. I'll let you try again."  So Hilda made a new plate of spaghetti for Randy. This time it wasn't blue and came with a salad with cheese. Randy said, "That's much better!" Then he started to eat. Suddenly Randy spit out all the spaghetti because there was a big nasty bug in it. This made Randy very angry and he threw all the spaghetti on the floor. Hilda said, "I'm so sorry, I don't know how that got there!" Randy calmed down and said, "I'm sorry too. Let's forget the spaghetti. I can eat the salad instead." When Randy finished the salad, Hilda asked if Randy wanted dessert. Randy said "no" because he was too full.
