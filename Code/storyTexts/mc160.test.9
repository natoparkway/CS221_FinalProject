Emily and her brother Matthew went outside to play.  They brought their dog Bo with them, too.  Bo was holding a bone in her mouth.  Matthew threw a ball and Bo chased after it.  Emily laughed as Bo ran away.  Bo brought the ball back to Matthew.  Then Bo barked.  This time Emily threw the ball.  She was younger than Matthew, so the ball did not go as far.  Bo chased after the ball anyway, and Emily laughed again.  Matthew smiled at his little sister.  Bo ran back to Emily and dropped the ball at her feet.  Then Bo wagged her tail and licked Emily's face.  Emily giggled and scratched Bo's ears.  Then Matthew and Emily's mother came outside holding a bar of soap.  She told them that it was time for dinner and they had to come inside and wash their hands.  Just then, Matthew and Emily's dad came home from work.  Matthew and Emily ran to their dad.  They all walked inside together and Bo followed them in.  They would have to play ball tomorrow.
