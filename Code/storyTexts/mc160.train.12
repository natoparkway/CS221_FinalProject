James is going to the baseball field with his friend Tommy.  James has to practice because baseball season starts in a week.  He wants to be a good player when the season starts.  James has been lazy in practicing so he is not very good at baseball right now.  He has to make up for it by playing baseball for 5 hours every day for a week.  James thinks this is enough practice for him to catch up and be a good player when the season starts.  So James and Tommy practice every day.  They throw the ball around.  They practice batting and they practice fielding.  Tommy begins to see that James is getting better every day.  He says "I do not believe it, James, but I think you are going to be pretty good when the season starts!"  Usually a week is not enough time to get pretty good at baseball but James is practicing so much he is fitting a month of practice into one week.  Then James has a setback.  His glove rips during practice.  He can't keep playing with a broken glove!  So Tommy and James go around town collecting bottles to trade in for five cents for each bottle.  James misses a day of practicing but they find enough bottles to turn in for thirty dollars.  This is enough money for James to buy a new glove!  So James buys a new glove and he and Tommy go back to the field and practice some more.  By the time the season comes James is one of the best players on his team.
