There once was a clown named Happy who traveled with the circus.  He was one of the most famous clowns of all time, because he was once the star of a movie.  Happy did a lot of things in his act that were very silly.  He was best known for belting out songs in the wrong key, which would make neighborhood cats meow and howl. Happy would do other funny things in his act, like wrestle a big plastic alligator with tape over its mouth.  He would also throw buckets of water at the people watching the circus, wetting all the people in the front seats.   One day, a driver in the circus needed to brush his teeth because he had been eating popcorn all day. He was out of toothpaste, so he went to ask Happy if he could borrow some.  Happy was eating a brownie, and his mouth was very full.  When he tried to talk, he sounded sillier than ever.  The driver laughed and asked Happy to point to the toothpaste. Happy pointed over to the sink, and the driver picked up the toothpaste and left.  The driver didn't know that it was trick toothpaste that was pumpkin flavor.  The driver hated pumpkin flavor! It tasted so bad. So he took the toothpaste and put it back on Happy's sink.  He never borrowed Happy's toothpaste ever again.
