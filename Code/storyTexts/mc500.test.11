Jenny loves singing. But her baby sister is crying so loud that Jenny can't hear herself, so she was angry! Her Mom said she could try to play with her sister, but that only made her baby sister cry louder.  Jenny tried to ask the baby to stop crying, but that didn't work. Jenny was getting tired, but she had an idea. She would give her baby sister one of her toy horses. The baby loved horses! The baby played with the horse, but then she started crying again. This made Jenny sad. She wanted to sing! Then she had a great idea. She would give the baby a pacifier! This worked. The baby stopped crying and Jenny started singing. Everyone was so happy!
