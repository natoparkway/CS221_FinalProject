There was once a lion that lived in a circus. This lion, King, was the biggest lion in the zoo, and he was often mean to the other lions in the circus. He was giant, and because of this, he scared the other lions, including the smallest one, Lionel. Lionel was often bullied by King, and the other lions, like Mack and Oscar, who copied him. Lionel was hiding one day from King, when the man who owned the circus took King out for training. King had to perform very difficult jobs for the circus, and when he did not get them right away, the circus man was very mean to King. King came back to the lion pen and was very scared and hurt. All of the other lions, even Mack and Oscar, ignored King, except for Lionel. Lionel sat down next to King and scared away the lion cubs who might have bothered King. King was very glad for what Lionel did. When King kept learning the new stuff for the circus man, Lionel kept him company when he got back. Soon, they grew to be good friends, and King found himself very sorry for all of the mean things he did to Lionel.
