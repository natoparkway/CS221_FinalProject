Once upon a time there was a little boy who had a rock. The rock was his favorite toy. He would throw his rock at trees, or roll his rock down hills. Sometimes he would stand at the river shore, dropping his rock in the water. He thought it was great fun to listen to the rock splash.  One day, the little boy met a brown cow. "Moo!" said the cow.  "Hello," said the boy. "Would you like to see my rock?"  The boy held out his rock for the cow to see. The cow looked at it. Then it picked it up in its mouth.  "Moo," said the cow.  "Hey," the boy said. "Give me back my rock!"  The boy tried to pull open the cow's mouth. Then he tried sticking his fingers in the cow's nose, so it would open its mouth to breathe. Then he tried tickling the cow, but it wouldn't open its mouth.  "Moo," it said. Then it swallowed the rock, and the little boy went home and cried.
