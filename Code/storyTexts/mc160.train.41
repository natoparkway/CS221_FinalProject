Late in the evening, the wind blew hard around the little house. The sound of the wind is like someone crying. It made the old woman nervous. She had not been getting much sleep lately, but with the wind making the spooky noise, she didn't know what else to do but lie down and try to rest a little.  Once she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept her mind busy. She still was having trouble falling asleep. She remembered being a little girl and her dad putting the finishing touches on the house. Her mom loved the big kitchen, and she and her younger sister had their own room in the back.  It was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep. The crying sound got louder. It didn't seem like it was outside. It sounded like it was coming from the other side of the bed. When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister. She still looked five years old. The old woman couldn't remember her any other way, as she had died from a sickness at age five.  "What's wrong?" she asked her sister. "I miss you. I am so lonely," answered the little girl, who was so thin you could see through her. The old lady closed her eyes and reached for her sister. That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling.  "She died in her sleep." "It is best that way."
