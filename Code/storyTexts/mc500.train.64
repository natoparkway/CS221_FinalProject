Andy the lion lived in Africa.  He was a happy lion, and he liked to lay in the sun all day.  One day when Andy got hungry, he thought about strawberries.  He had never had a strawberry before.  "Oh," he thought, "strawberries must be very tasty."  He thought about how red they were, and how sweet they must taste.  "I have to have a strawberry," said Andy.  So Andy went to talk to his friends, to find out if they had any strawberries.  He walked to a big field where he saw his friend Billy the Bison.  Andy asked Billy if he had any strawberries.  "No, I don't," said Billy, "All I have is a banana."  Andy was sad, because he really wanted a strawberry, but he wouldn't stop there.  Andy walked to the river to find his friend Charlie, the duck.  It was a long way to walk, but Andy really wanted a strawberry.  When he finally got there, he asked, "Do you have any strawberries?"  "No," said Charlie, "I only have is an apple."  This made Andy really sad, but he wouldn't stop there.  Andy knew that he only knew one other friend who might have a strawberry, and that was David the Elephant.  So he walked and walked and walked until he was finally at his friend David's house.  Andy was tired, but wouldn't give up.  Andy asked, "Do you have any strawberries?"  David said, "Yes!  Help yourself."  Andy was excited, and finally tasted his first strawberry.  Andy thought it was tasty.
