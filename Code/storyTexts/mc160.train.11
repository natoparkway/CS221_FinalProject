Once upon a time there was a man who needed to write story. His name was Mark. He had a bad case of writer's block. After a bit, he wrote a story about writing a story. This may seem a bit odd. Well, it was. The important thing to know is that Mark wanted money. This was so he could show off for his girl, Wendy. Wendy had two living parents named Greg and Gail. The exciting thing about Mark writing these stories, was that he could write whatever he wanted to. He could have written about bears. Or it could have been his best friend Error. There were so many choices for Mark. He was very happy. He was happy because he was almost done writing the story. Wendy, had she known about the writing would have been sad that Mark spent so much time thinking of odd stories.
