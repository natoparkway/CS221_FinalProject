When Graham was a little boy, he really like giraffes.  They were his favorite animal to see at the zoo.  He liked giraffes more than elephants, pandas, tigers or lions.  He dreamed of going to Africa to see giraffes in the wild.  He told his family how much he liked them and they made sure he had plenty of books about giraffes.  At school, he often wrote his reports about giraffes.  He even painted his room with spots to look like a giraffe.  When he got older, he went to school to study giraffes and other animals.  Finally, during his final year of school, he went to Africa to study giraffes in their home.    While there he met many people who also liked giraffes.  He liked seeing how tall the giraffes were.  He found that their homes were being destroyed by people using the land.  Graham started an organization which raised money to help buy land for the giraffes to live on.  Graham used everything he knew about giraffes to teach other people.  He gave speeches, wrote books, made signs and sent letters telling people about the giraffes' home being destroyed.
