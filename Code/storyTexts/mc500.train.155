Ms. Strawberry loved to make vanilla cupcakes! Everyone loved her cupcakes, and she loved making them, too. One morning, she was in the store, buying ingredients for her  cupcakes, when she came across the most delicious looking chocolate frosting she had ever seen in her life! She bought a whole bunch, excited about how delicious her cupcakes would be for her cupcake party tonight! She went home and took extra care making her cupcakes that afternoon. She made them extra fluffy, sweet and delicious. She even pulled out her favorite sprinkles for her cupcakes, bright purple ones, which was her favorite color. She couldn't believe how amazing her cupcakes were going to be for the cupcake party! That night at the cupcake party, Ms. Strawberry showed everyone her plate of delicious cupcakes! So many of her friends were there for the party. There was Mrs. Apple, Mr. Banana, Ms. Mitten, Mr. Green and even quiet Mr. Lemon showed up. Everyone was very happy about her cupcakes! Everyone except Mr. Lemon. Mr. Lemon took one bite of that cupcake and said, "Eew! This is the worst cupcake in the world!" Ms. Strawberry didn't know what to say! Were they really the worst cupcakes in the world? She had tried so hard! Ms. Strawberry started to cry. "Why don't you like my cupcakes, Mr. Lemon? I worked so hard to make the extra delicious!" Mr. Lemon said, "I don't like vanilla, and I don't like chocolate!" Ms. Strawberry cried even more! "There, there," said Mrs. Apple, and patted Ms. Strawberry on the head.  "It's okay. Not everyone is going to like your cupcakes! You only have to know that you worked hard and that they're still tasty!" With that, Ms. Strawberry stopped crying, and she and Mr. Lemon made up.
