Dan and his class were going to the ocean. Along with his class there were three adults going to make sure no one was left at the beach. Dan had three friends who were going too. His friends who were going were Tom, Steve and Jeff. Tom was the first one on the bus. Dan was the second one on the bus. Steve got on next and then Jeff got on last. If the sun was shining and there was not a storm, Dan was going to get to go on a boat to look for fish. If there was a storm then Dan would have to stay on the bus and he would not even get to walk on the beach or look for sea shells. Dan was happy to see that there was not a storm. Dan ran off the bus. He was so fast that he beat Tom getting off the bus. Jeff got off the bus before Dan, but Dan even beat Steve getting off the bus.  Dan and his friends had a fun day on the boat looking for fish.
