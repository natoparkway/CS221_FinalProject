Little Tony was riding his bicycle all around the party. After all grandma gave him it right now. What fun would it be for Tony if he couldn't show off his new bike? He rode it up and down the hills and through the people at the party. It was his party. Everyone knew that it was his party. He was turning 8, 8 candles on the cake and the number 8 frosted on, the number 8 on his birthday hat. The big 8. It was much better than his last birthday. He didn't like being 7. He loved riding his bike closer and closer to people and things. Until he ran right into the big table with his birthday cake. All 8 candles flew all over the ground of the lawn. Tony was upset, and so was daddy at the big huge mess he made. He could have been more careful daddy said, and looked where he was going. He was right, Tony was being too crazy. But it was his party, so he kept riding, with more care this time. He rode his bike up and down. Faster and faster. Until Tony's birthday finally was over, long after it began.
