The turtle and the fox were best friends.  One day Turtle wanted to find Fox and ask if he would come fishing with him.  Turtle went to foxes house.  Fox was not home.  Turtle went to look for Fox.  Fox lived near several friends.  Turtle went to Bear's house first.  Bear lived next door to Fox.  Bear answered the door, but Fox wasn't there.  Turtle went to Duck's house next.  Duck lived next door to Bear.  Duck answered the door, but Fox wasn't there.  Turtle went to Goose's house next. Goose answered the door, but Fox wasn't there. Finally, Turtle stopped at Rabbit's house.  Rabbit wasn't home, and Fox wasn't there.  Turtle was sad because he wanted to go fishing with his friend.  He walked slowly toward the stream to go fishing by himself.  When he got to the stream, he found Fox and Rabbit were there.  They were fishing.  They asked Turtle to join them.  Turtle was very happy that he had found Fox, and he joined them for a fun afternoon of fishing in the stream.
