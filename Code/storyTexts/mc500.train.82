There were four brothers that lived together in a small house on the east side of town.  The brothers' names were Bob, Billy, Bryan and Baker.  Each brother was one year in age.  The oldest brother Bob was nine, the second eight, the third seven and the youngest was only six.  Each boy also had something that they were good at that no one else could do.  Baker, the youngest boy was good at magic tricks. Bob was the basketball star, Billy was great at football and Bryan was good at baseball. Each boy liked to watch the others show off their skills.  One afternoon Baker put on a magic show.  For this trick he would need three things.  First, he needed four cups each a different color.  The cups colors were green, yellow, blue, and white.  He would need one white ball and two helpers which the parents happily volunteered for.  He started by showing his brothers the inside of each cup as well as the normal white ball.  He then placed the white ball inside the white cups and moved them around really fast.  Next his parents covered the four cups with a magic blanket.  Baker said some magic words and then his helpers removed the blanket.  To his brothers amazement there were only the three colored cups left.  Each brother got to look under a cup.  After flipping up each cup they saw that there was no white ball.  Just a single green ball inside the green cup!  How did you do that they yelled!  A magician never gives up his secrets.
