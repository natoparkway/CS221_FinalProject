Tommy's birthday is next week.  He is hoping for a very special gift.  What are some things Tommy is hoping for?  He would like a big, bouncy ball, like his friends Bobby and Joey have.  One with blue stripes!  He would really like some new sneakers.  Danny, Tommy's best friend, got a special pair of sneakers for HIS birthday last month.  They have pictures of robots on them and even light up when you walk!  He would really, REALLY like a shiny new bicycle.  Tommy has an old bicycle now. He is getting too big for it.  He saw a red one in the store yesterday when he was shopping with his Mom.  It looked like it was the right size for him!  But what Tommy wants most of all is a new baby brother.  Today his Mom and Dad said that he might have one very, very soon.  Then Tommy and his little brother can have many fun birthdays together.  That would be the best gift of all!
