Jane was good at basketball but she liked soccer more.  She played forward for her soccer team on Saturday morning.  A man in a black and white striped shirt blew his whistle to start the game.  It was hot so Jane's coach handed out orange slices for the players to eat at half time.  Jane's team was winning but she was more excited for what she would do in the afternoon.  Her father was going to take her to watch a baseball game.  When the soccer game was over, Jane took off her soccer shoes and put them next to her father's running shoes in the back of his car.  Jane and her father drove to the baseball game.  After buying their tickets, they went to find their seats.  A man in a green shirt stood at the top of the stairs in their section.  He showed them where their seats were.  Jane saw a lot of empty peanut shells on the ground near their seats.  A man in a blue shirt was yelling for people to buy some cotton candy.  Jane's father bought them hot dogs to eat instead.  Jane put ketchup and mustard on hers.  The home team was named the Cardinals and they wore red.  The pitcher threw the first pitch and everyone cheered.
