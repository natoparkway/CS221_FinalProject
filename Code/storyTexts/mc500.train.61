The chipmunks were busy getting ready for the winter.  Little Chip had never seen everyone so busy.  Chipmunks were running this way and that way.  Even his Granddaddy was helping out, stuffing melons up into the holes in the tree.  Aunt Chippa was clapping at everyone to hurry them up.  Little Chip wasn't sure what they were all doing.  His mom had told him, "Getting ready for winter" but Little Chip didn't know what that meant.  He sat on the seesaw trying to guess.  He knew that people were gathering things.  Now that he thought about it, they were gathering food!  Little Chip thought for a second...could they be gathering food for a party?  That couldn't be it, everyone was gathering so much food that not every chipmunk in the town could come close to eating all the food for a single party.  Little Chip looked at his big toe and thought.  He saw another chipmunk digging in the ground and stuffing more food there.  Was the guy trying to plant seeds to grow?  Seeds wouldn't grow in the winter, it's too cold!  Little Chip sat up and knew why everyone was so busy! Winter is coming!
