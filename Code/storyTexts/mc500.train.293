Josh was going on an adventure.  He was going to float down the river with his friends, Dennis and Connor.  They had been building a boat out of wood Connor's father had given them for the last week.  The boys wanted to paint the boat because the brown wood did not look very good.  Josh wanted green, Dennis liked purple and Connor said it would look good if it was red.  They had to call their friend, Tonya, to help choose.  Tonya thought the same as Josh on the color so that is what they painted the boat.  To thank Tonya for helping them choose the color, the boys invited her to come with them.  All four of them carried the boat through the vegetable garden in the back yard.  They were very careful not to step on any of the carrots, potatoes or green beans.  Josh's mother had packed some food for them to eat as they floated down the river.  Everything was in a big basket.  There were peanut butter sandwiches, potato chips and cupcakes with strawberry frosting.  Each person had a job on the boat.  Josh was the captain.  Dennis made sure the snacks did not get wet.  Tonya watched for rocks ahead.  Connor had to steer the boat.
