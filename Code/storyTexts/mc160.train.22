There was once a small town by a river. There were many houses in this town and they were all different colors, shapes and sizes. which made the people happy.  On one street there was a red house, a green house, a blue house and one purple house with yellow stripes. The people in the town were all very friendly and knew each other well.  When the people of the town went out they loved to wear hats but never wore shoes and the hats were also many different colors, shapes and sizes. On Sundays all the families in town would go to the park by the river and have picnics. The children would run, skip and play and the parents would talk, eat and laugh. The children loved the picnic foods they had. There were hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken and steak. They also had salads, coleslaw, fries and chips. The kids' favorite was hamburgers with fries.  On days when it rained the children and parents would stay inside and read or color pictures and drink hot chocolate and they loved to wear big warm sweaters. At night the family would all go to the kitchen and cook dinner together and after dinner was finished they would all clear the table and clean the dishes together before getting ready for bed. They would put their pajamas on but never wear socks and they would get under the covers and fall asleep.
