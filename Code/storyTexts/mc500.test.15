It was finally summer vacation, and Josh was excited to go to his favorite place. He was heading to Florida, to visit his Grandma and Grandpa. Josh spends every summer there, and this summer would be no different! In the mornings, Josh and Grandma would plant cucumbers, tomatoes, and carrots in the ground. After they would be planted, they would water and weed the garden every day. In the afternoons, Grandpa would take Josh out on the ocean in his sailboat which was named "Sea girl." Josh loved "Sea girl" and his favorite part was smelling the salty ocean air. Sometimes Josh and Grandpa would go to a beach and make sandcastles, or start digging until they found buried sea shells or other treasures. At night, Grandma and Grandpa would make dinner and they would eat outside by the pool. On special nights, Josh got to get ice cream for dessert. A lot of times, Grandma made dinner dishes that included the vegetables Josh and Grandma were growing. It was his favorite time of year. Josh couldn't wait to leave tomorrow morning!
