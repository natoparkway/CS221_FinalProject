Once upon a time a driver was taking some meat to the store.  But he hit a turtle.  Then he hit another turtle.  The driver was sad.  So he put the turtles in the trash.  Then he felt better.  The driver told his mommy that he needed to look in the mirror, so she said he could.  The driver wanted to go back to work.  On the way to work he saw a man with a firework.  He watched the man light the firework.  It was fun, but the driver needed to get back to work.  This time he took a chair to the store.  It was a fun job.  The driver was very busy all day long.  He wanted to go home and have fun, but he was busy working.  The driver was a good worker and worked all day so he didn't go home and have fun.
