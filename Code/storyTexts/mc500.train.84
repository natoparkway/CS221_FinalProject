Ellie and her grandfather went to the beach late in the afternoon.  "Why are we going to the beach, Grandpa?" Ellie asked.  He smiled a big old smile.  "We're looking for treasure," he said.  He carried two small plastic shovels and a basket.  "What's in the basket?" she asked.  "Some pie and soda to celebrate when we find our treasure."  He gave his granddaughter a happy laugh.  They picked a spot and started digging.  They found only sand.  They picked another spot by some rocks and found all sorts of small and interesting little stones.  Ellie grinned at their odd shapes and colors.  They dug further away from the water and found an old bottle.  Ellie threw it away into the trash can.  They dug closer to the water and found many sea shells.  Ellie clapped happily at how smooth and nice they felt.  They had much fun digging, but it started to get late. Her grandpa seemed sad.  "We did not find any treasure after all," he said.  "How about that, grandpa?" she said, pointing toward the pretty sunset that made the water appear yellow and bright.  He grandfather laughed.  "That is a great treasure after all."  Ellie and her grandfather laughed and hugged.  They ate pie happily and watched the sun set.
