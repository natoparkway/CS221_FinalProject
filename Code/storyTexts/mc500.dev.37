Lions get very lonely sometimes but they have a difficult time trying to make friends. Lions have big teeth, sharp claws, and sometimes, they are very cranky. They don't always get along with other animals or humans, so they have to get rid of their anger and their crazy emotions to make and keep friends. Zebras and lions like to play tag, but sometimes it gets a little rough and zebra gets hurt. When that happens, a nice lion needs to say sorry and to try to find another friend. A lion might go up to a chicken and smile, or maybe a lion might bring a horse some flowers or food to make him or her less nervous. It's not easy to be friends with a lion, but a friendship takes time and a lot of hard work and that's what is most important! Also, my auntie always told me to be strong like a lion but to always be nice. Having big teeth, sharp claws, and being cranky is not good, and we need to work hard to be the opposite of that to make sure we keep our friends.
