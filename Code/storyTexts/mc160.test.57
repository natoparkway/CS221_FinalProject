Penelope kissed her hamster named Cracker. She waved goodbye to her brother, Jacob. Penelope ran out the door. Penelope's neighbor, Mrs. Flower, said she would make banana pancakes for Penelope for breakfast. Penelope could also play with Mrs. Flower's new puppy, Cookie. Penelope saw a bowl with green beans, beets, and carrots from the store on the kitchen table.  Yuck, thought Penelope.  Penelope liked the new puppy.  Cookie had a funny smile. Mrs. Flower gave Penelope a box of toys and told her to take Cookie to the backyard. Penelope was busy looking at the green tomatoes.  She turned around and saw Cookie and Mr. Flower's cat, Thomas. Thomas and Cookie were playing with the toys. Thomas kicked a ball to Cookie and Cookie kicked the ball back. Cookie got a toy fish out the box. Thomas and Cookie played catch with the toy fish.  Penelope was laughing because she never saw a dog and cat play together.  Mrs. Flower came to the backyard.  She asked Penelope if she wanted yogurt, apple sauce or chocolate pudding with her breakfast. Penelope said she wanted yogurt. Penelope went inside and ate her breakfast with Mrs. Flower and Mr. Flower.
