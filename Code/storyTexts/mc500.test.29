One morning a girl named Ashely woke up before her Mom and Dad and started watching TV. Once her parents woke up, everybody got dressed to go food shopping for the week. Food shopping was one of Ashley's favorite things to do. The family got to the grocery store and grabbed a shopping cart. The first foods they ran into were the fruits. Ashley ran to pick her favorite fruit, apples, while her parents went and got other things that they needed, like the sour lemons. As the family kept walking through the grocery store Ashley begged for some candy that she saw, but the other things her parents bought were eggs, milk and bread. After all of the food was picked out, the family went up to the check-out line to pay for their food. Ashley never liked the check-out line, as it always took too long, but today was different. The checkout lady, Sarah, was extra nice to her and as she was waiting for her parents to pay, Ashley's father picked out a candy for her to have. It was her favorite, chocolate! Ashley was so excited that she thanked her parents the whole ride home, and even said she would make breakfast. When the family got home that afternoon and the food was in the house, the whole family made their lunch of eggs and toast together.
