Bobby was a little barn mouse and loved to sleep on a blanket. Every day in the morning, Bobby would wake up and fold his little blue blanket that he slept on. Bobby's uncle Arthur got the blanket for Bobby from in the big house. Bobby loved this blanket more than any other thing he had. Bobby had a lot of neat stuff. He had a penny, a safety pin and an earring. He found all of these when he would walk through the forest in the afternoon. Bobby's uncle Arthur would always take walks with him through the forest, to make sure that Bobby didn't get in any trouble. Bobby had to be careful that people didn't see him, because the people didn't like mice. Bobby didn't understand, because people liked other animals, but would scream if they saw a mouse. They didn't scream if they saw a dog, cat or chicken. Bobby thought the dogs were the scariest and people might rather scream when they saw dogs and not mice.
