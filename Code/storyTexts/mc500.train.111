Will was playing his favorite song.  The song was about a flower.  Will stopped singing and went outside.  A single star was out in the night sky.  Will got hungry and went inside to get a biscuit.  He also had jam with it.  He didn't want chicken, gravy, or butter on his biscuit.  Will sat and finished his dinner in the kitchen.  Will walked over to the living room.  On his way there, he put a napkin in the trashcan.  When he was in the living room, it started to rain.  It stopped raining and Will walked all the way to the store.  When at the store, Will had a good laugh at a very silly looking dog.  Will heard it start to thunder.  Will looked outside to see if it was raining again, and it was not.  Will was happy he didn't have to get wet walking home.  He went outside smiling.
