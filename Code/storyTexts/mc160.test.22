Jim and Linda are our neighbors.  Jim and Linda have an old dog named Reggie.  We love our neighbors.  They are like the perfect grandparents.   We watch Reggie for them when they go out of town to see their children and grandchildren.  Reggie is so fun to have around.  He is 14 years old.  We have 3 other dogs and Reggie is older than all of them.  They all listen to what Reggie tells them to do.  It is fun to see them respect him.  We are watching Reggie now.  He is staying with us for 3 weeks.  He likes to go for rides in the car.  He likes to go for walks.  This time, when Jim and Linda dropped Reggie off, Jim picked up mom's guitar and played us a song.  He was really good!  Then Jim and Linda sang a song for us.  I can see why Reggie misses them when they are gone.  They are so nice!  We give Reggie lots of love so that he is happy at our house when they are on vacation.  He likes our dogs and cats.  We have a big black dog named Able.  We have a little dog named Mudpuppy and we have a puppy named Goldberry.  We have two cats.  One of our cats is named Glitch.  She has lots of colors.  We also have a white kitten named Vex.  One of the best things about watching Reggie is that we know when Jim and Linda come home, Linda bakes us a cherry pie for taking care of Reggie.  She makes delicious pie. We are very lucky to have such nice neighbors!
