There was once a tiny pig who lived on a farm. He was a very cute animal, and he knew it. He liked to stay clean and soft and look as good as he could. When he had to go in the mud, he always wore black rain boots, a black rain hat, and a yellow rain coat. This helped keep the mud off. He didn't want it getting on his soft pink skin.  This tiny pig lived with his aunt, who loved to get dirty. "You shouldn't stay so clean!" she told him. "We're pigs! We love the mud!" But the tiny pig kept wearing his boots, coat, and hat.   One day, all the pigs were standing and eating their lunch. They had corn, oats, apples, and bread, and they all dug in. But the tiny pig wouldn't eat any of it. He had left his bib at home and didn't want to get his clothes dirty. He stood and looked sad as the other pigs ate their fill. They were getting brown mud all over them.  "Come on," said his aunt. "You can get some bread crumbs on yourself. It's okay." But the tiny pig only stood there and looked blue.   Suddenly, a car drove up. The driver was doing too fast and splashed some mud on the tiny pig. The tiny big was sad and mad. But then the people in the car got out.   "Look at how cute that little muddy pig is!" said one.   "He's so cute!" said the other.   "Really?" said the tiny pig.   "Yes!" said his aunt. "For the last time, everybody knows that pigs get muddy!"  So the tiny pig went and dug in to the food with all the other pigs. He ate a big piece of bread. He got crumbs all over himself.
