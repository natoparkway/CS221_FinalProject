Mike likes the man. Mike is a gray, winter glove the man found in the snow. The man likes to bring lost gloves home. He puts them in a box. The gloves are warm and safe in the box. They also get to meet new friends when the man finds them and puts them in the box. Mike has made many new friends since the man found him. He has become good friends with Roger, Katie, and Jane. Two of them, Roger and Katie, were found in the snow, like Mike. Jane was not. She was found in a pile of leaves. Roger is a bright orange glove, Jane is a pink mitten, and Katie is a pink glove with purple fingers. Jane also has a friend named Rich. He is a large, black glove who the man found in a building. Mike has met him, but they are not good friends yet. They all like to play tag and talk about how much they like their new lives. Mike is really happy the man found him and he made so many new friends.
