Bob is a young child who eats potatoes. He normally wakes up around 7 in the morning. He has a dog named Gob. Gob is a very smart dog. Bob also owns a farm. He grows potatoes on it. One day he went out with his dog to go check on the farm. There they found a wild duck, a cat, and a pumpkin. Gob started to chase the duck. The duck flew away. Gob started to get hungry. Gob then ate the pumpkin. Bob got mad at Gob for eating the pumpkin. Bob then threw Gob into the house. Bob then grabbed a bucket. He started to collect as many potatoes as he could find. Bob loved potatoes. He collected around 600 potatoes! Bob started to run out of room for all the potatoes he found. He then started to eat as many as he could. In 1 hour he ate 100 potatoes! He got so full he took a nap. When he awoke he found the cat eating all the potatoes! The cat ate 200 potatoes before Bob awoke. However, Bob was too full and fat to move. The cat laughed and wanted to eat the potatoes again. Just then, Gob comes running out to chase the cat away! The cat was too fat to run away. It had eaten too many potatoes! Gob grabbed the cat with his teeth and tossed the cat down a well. Gob became a hero for saving the potatoes! Bob now lets Gob eat whatever he wants, including pumpkins! Gob is a very happy dog now!
