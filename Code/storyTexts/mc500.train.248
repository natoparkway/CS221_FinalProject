Bob rode his bike to his house on Monday.  He wanted to get home to get some yogurt.  On Tuesday, Bob looked over his shoulder and saw Matt.  Matt was looking around in the fridge.  On Friday, Bob walked on the ice.  He fell down.  Matt had a saying for such things, but he forgot what it was.  Matt played ball with a duck.  He did not play ball with a dog, cat, or mouse.  On Sunday, Bob wrote a lot down on a piece of paper.  Bob wrote a lot about his lip.  Bob then walked around.  Bob took a look at a pan in the kitchen.  Bob then walked around in the vegetable garden.  Matt was standing in the garden.  Matt asked Bob if he wanted to play.  Bob said no.  Bob did not want to play with anyone.  Matt walked away.  Bob went inside.  Bob walked into the living room and sat on the couch.
