Jenny and Katie were very happy.  Their mom was taking them to the circus.  She had told them about it on Tuesday.  They were going on Saturday afternoon.  Their dad said they had to do their chores Saturday morning first or they would not get to go.  They were going to get up early and get them done.  They had been looking forward to this for the last few days.  They had told their grandma and grandpa all about it when they saw them on Wednesday.  It was hard to sleep, they were so excited and could not wait to go.  They could not wait to get an elephant ride.  They did this last year and thought it was so fun. Jenny wanted to see the monkeys, too; they were her favorite.  Katie couldn't wait to see the lions; she thought they were the best.
