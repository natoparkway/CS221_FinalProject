Suzie's cat, Peaches, was missing. She was very scared. Suzie got on her bicycle to look for her. She looked up and down the street for Peaches and called for her, but Peaches did not come.  \tabSuzie went to the lake and found a turtle. "Mr. Turtle," she said. "Have you seen my cat, Peaches?" \tab"No, Suzie," said Mr. Turtle. He was very old, and didn't see very well. "I can barely see my own shell."  \tab"I'm sorry," said Suzie. "But I have to find Peaches. It's almost time for her supper." \tabShe went further down the street, and met a puppy. "Hello, puppy," she said. "Have you seen my cat, Peaches?" \tabThe puppy was new, and had not met Peaches yet. "I don't know who Peaches is," he said. "But I'll let you know if I meet her." \tabSuzie thanked the puppy and looked a little more before going home. It was dark, and the stars were out. Suzie cried, and wished upon a star. "Please let Peaches come home safe," she wished. \tabThe star twinkled, and Suzie heard a meow. It was Peaches' voice! Peaches had been hiding under Suzie's bed all along! Peaches jumped into Suzie's lap, and Suzie hugged her and gave her her dinner, and then they went to bed and fell asleep.
