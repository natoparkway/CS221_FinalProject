Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named Scoop. He was a very friendly giraffe and he was cute, too. He had beautiful orange and yellow markings and he loved to play with his friends, but Scoop had a problem. His neck was really short, so he could not reach the tall plants and his mommy and daddy had to get all of his food for him.  One day, Scoop's friend Scap, invited him over for a sleepover party. It sounded like so much fun, but Scoop was too embarrassed. He didn't want everyone to laugh at him at feeding time when he couldn't reach the food by himself, so he said he could not come to the party  Scap was a really good friend and he knew that Scoop wanted to come to the party, so he came up with a plan.  That afternoon, Scap gathered all the little giraffes in the neighborhood and they spent the day together collecting food. They then went to Scoop's house and showed him all the food they had gathered for the party and once again invited him along. He happily said yes and they all had a wonderful time.
