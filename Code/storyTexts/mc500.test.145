Anna's parents told her they were going to have a new baby brother.  She had never had a brother before.  She was not sure what to think about it.  "What if he cries?" asked Anna.  "If he cries we hold him until he is quiet," said Anna's dad.  "What if he makes a mess in his diaper?" asked Anna.  "Diapers smell but we clean them up," said Anna's mom.  Anna thought about having a baby brother.  Her mom and dad would take care of him. They bought a high chair for him to eat in.  They brought out her old crib for him to sleep in.  What could she do to help?  Anna wanted to help the baby play.  She thought it would be fun to play with him.    Anna saved up her money.  She had two whole dollars.  She went to the store to pick out a present for the baby.  She bought a rattle.  It cost all the money she had, but Anna was happy.  She could give a gift to the new baby.
