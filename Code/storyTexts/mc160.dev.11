Once upon a time a young boy and young girl set out on a trip to the beach. They packed a few towels, an umbrella, a few beach chairs and a lunch cooler. They drove to the crowded beach parking lot and spent almost an hour trying to find a parking spot. Once they found a spot they parked and began walking to the beach area. They found a nice spot with a good view of the water and set up their belongings. Once they sat down they began to enjoy a nice lunch on the beach. They watched the boats go by and people playing in the water. It was a wonderful day and one they would always remember. Once they arrived home they suddenly found out that they both had a pretty good sunburn. They both said that next time they would use sun screen.
