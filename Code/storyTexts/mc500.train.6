Sally was looking through her closet for some clothes to wear to the school dance tomorrow night. She had a lot of clothes to look through, but she needed something perfect for the dance, since she would be seen by a lot of other people, and she wanted to stand out from the rest of the girls. There would be a lot of boys there, too. If she looked as nice as she imagined she could, she would have a lot of boys asking her to dance. And she didn't want to dance alone, because that would make her feel sad.  But she had to hurry, since it was getting late, and she had to sleep soon. She was so excited, that she barely touched her baked potato she had during suppertime. She also had chicken, some green beans, and corn on the cob.  She came down to four choices for what she could wear to the dance. a pink dress, a green dress, a red dress, and a yellow dress. She tried on each one and looked at herself in the mirror to see how she looked. She chose the yellow dress, because it was the prettiest. After making her choice, she changed into her pajamas and got in bed. She turned the light out and fell asleep. She dreamed about the fun she would have at the dance. Sally smiled as she slept.
