One hot afternoon in the summertime a family and their dog were getting ready to have a dinnertime picnic in the park. The dishes in the picnic included peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, watermelons, potato salad, and chocolate cookies. When they got to the park the father, George, was looking for a good place to have the picnic. While they were walking they bumped into their neighbors, Robert and Natalie, and their twins, Anson and Anne and their dog Emile. Robert explained that it was the twins' birthday and they were celebrating by going out for a walk. They said goodbye and kept looking for a picnic spot. He chose a nice spot under a tree that would keep the family cool. While setting up the picnic, the mother, Barbara, told the son, Ralph to go play with their dog, Scout, to pass some time until it was time for dinner. Ralph found a stick and began to play fetch with Scout down the hill. Some time passed and Ralph began to return to the picnic with Scout. Along the way back he picked a flower to give to his mom because it was Mother's day. When he arrived he gave the flower to his mom and she said, "Thank you so much, Ralph!" His mother poured him a cool and tasty glass of lemonade. It tasted extra good because it was so hot outside! Ralph sat down and enjoyed the picnic with his family under the large tree.
