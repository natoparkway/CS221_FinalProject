Once there was a beautiful Queen.  She liked dancing.  She liked singing.  She liked playing.  But the thing she liked the most was eating ice cream.  She liked many kinds of ice cream, but her favorite was strawberry.  She liked it best because it was pink, and pink was her favorite color.  Because she liked eating ice cream so much, she wanted a kingdom wide ice cream eating holiday.  Everyone had to stop working and eat ice cream.  All of the people were happy with the new holiday.  It was summer, and everyone would rather eat ice cream than work.  The queen wanted to see what the favorite flavor of ice cream was in her kingdom.  Everyone got to say their favorite flavor.  159 people liked chocolate.  67 people liked vanilla.  382 people liked strawberry.  The queen was very happy that everyone liked strawberry as much as she did.  The king was not happy.  He liked chocolate the best.  He wanted to get rid of all of the strawberry ice cream so that chocolate could be the winner.  When the queen found out she was very sad.  Then she had an idea: chocolate strawberry ice cream.  The king liked the idea.  All the people liked the idea.  A new ice cream flavor was made and everyone loved it.
