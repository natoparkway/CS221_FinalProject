I have a friend who is a princess of the piggies. No, really! She lives in a piggy castle and has piggy gowns and piggy balls and a piggy carriage, though no piggy crown. She loves being a princess, but sometimes it gets boring. There's only so much fun to be had walking around a castle. She likes to cook too. So sometimes, she goes to the kitchen. She has a lot of fun in the kitchen making new foods. She likes to pretend she's a cook! Someday she wants to be a piggy princess cook! One of her favorite things to cook is pea soup. She loves soup, and pea soup most of all, even if tomato is pretty good too. She doesn't like vegetable or chicken soup at all. She grows her own peas, mushes them up in the soup, and then stirs it all up with a spoon. She also cooks it on the stove. She loves to cook, and I love to eat. We're best friends!
