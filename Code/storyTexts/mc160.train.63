A dancer named Eliza was part of the New York Ballet Performance and Arts Company. She spent all hours of the day practicing for her recital. Eliza had difficulties doing both her schoolwork and her dancing; she often fell behind in math. Her best friend Maddy was also a dancer; they often competed with each other to get the top parts in the dances. Their moms thought that because they competed with each other they might become mean towards one another but they did not let that get in the way of their friendship.  In their latest recital Eliza had got the top part in the dance called "The Beauty and the Rain". The hours were long and draining on their bodies. All the girls and boys who left the performance center looked so tired. They couldn't pick up their practice bags off of the floor as they walked to their parents to go home and their eyelids were droopy. When Eliza got home, the last thing on her mind was her math problems. All she could think of was bathing her sore feet and her head hitting her soft fluffy pillow.  Her teachers started to become aware of Eliza's problems in the classroom and called her parents into school to talk to her teachers. Her parents knew that dancing was Eliza's dream and would not let anything get in the way of her performances. It was important for her parents for Eliza to do well in all parts of her life, but her dancing is what lit a fire in her eyes. Her parents got her extra help to help with her homework, which helped Eliza keep track of all parts of her life.
