Today is the big day, today is Saturday and it is my birthday party.  I turned 7 on Thursday, but I wanted my party on the weekend.  All week my daddy and mommy helped me plan and now it is finally time for fun.  We got a clown and I got to invite all of my friends!  The clown's name was Bob and he was really funny.  Bob made us all laugh a lot.  After the clown left we all played fun games.  We played with a toy filled with candy and all got to eat it.  There were Twix Bars, Milky Ways, M&Ms and Tootsie Rolls.  My favorite candy is Twix so I was very happy to see them inside.  After that, my mom came out with my cake.  It was chocolate with chocolate icing!  Everyone loved it and we even got to eat ice cream too. We were going to eat hamburgers and hot dogs but my dog ate them all before we could. I wish we could have gone swimming in my pool, but it was too cold.  My dad said it was okay but my mom did not want us to get sick.  It was way better than any party I ever dreamed about.  After cake all my friends had to leave except for Timmy.  Timmy's mom said he could sleep over so we made a fort inside and told ghost stories.  My birthday party was the best day of my life.
