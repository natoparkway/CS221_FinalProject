One day, a dad and his daughter, named Sarah, went on a trip to pick pears from a tree. Sarah was wearing a pretty pink shirt and her dad was wearing a green shirt. Sarah's dad gave her a hug as they walked to the pear tree. When they picked pears, Sarah's dad had to lift her on his back, because she could not reach the pears high in the tree. Sarah and her dad picked thirty four in five hours! Sarah was hungry, so her dad said she could eat one of the pears they picked. While she was eating, she didn't say a word, but after she was done she said it was very tasty.  She said it was green and squishy so she needed a towel to wipe her face after she was done eating.  When they got home, Sarah's grandmother told her how proud she was of her granddaughter for picking all of the pears from the tree.  As Sarah was standing in the kitchen, watching her mom and sister put thirty three pears in the freezer, she thought about how much fun she had picking pears.
