A man got fired from his job.  He was in such a bad mood after.  He walked out the door with his gum and gloves.  He got madder and madder.  A mailman walking by asked him how his day had been.  He pushed the mailman who fell on a teacher.  A nearby baby started crying.  The man then felt bad and apologized.  He knew the only thing that could make him happy would be pancakes.  He went to a pancake restaurant and ordered a stack of pancakes.  He ate the pancakes he had put syrup on and helped a worker sweep the floor.  He had forgotten all about the firing from his other job.  The worker was so surprised with how helpful the man was he told his boss.  The boss talked to the man and asked if he'd like a job there.  The man was so happy that his day had made such a turn around!  He took the job and became head pancake maker.
