Billy and his friend Jake were walking together to meet their friends Kevin and Gordon at the park. They sometimes played in each Jake's backyard, but there was much more room at the park. And it was far too dangerous to play in the street. They were going to play touch football. They would sometimes played baseball and soccer, and even kickball but today the weather was perfect for football. The summer breeze almost blew Billy's cap off. Billy loved summertime. He liked the fall, too, when the leaves started to turn pretty colors. But he hated winter. Billy didn't like the snow. Spring was also nice. Jake was drinking a Pepsi, and Billy had a bottle of water. Gordon and Kevin would most likely be drinking blue or red Gatorade at the park where they waited.
