There once was a lion who did not roar, but instead he said meow. The lion was sad, because he could not roar like his other lion friends. The lion went to talk to his family. He first went to talk to his brother, but his brother was not home. Then he went to talk to his dad, but his dad was not home either. Luckily, the lion's sister was home. He asked his sister why he thought he could not roar. His sister said they need to go talk to their friend the squirrel. The squirrel lived in a tree with a nice door mat outside. The squirrel said to the lion if he wanted to start to roar instead of meow, then he need to run faster than the other lion's. So the next day, the lion played a game, in which he ran faster than all the other lions. Now, the lion roars and doesn't meow.
