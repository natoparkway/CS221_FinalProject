Billy and Sara are brother and sister. They went to the beach with their family last July for a week, and had the best time ever!  On Monday, Billy and Sara wanted to build a giant sandcastle.  They invited their new friends Jack and Jane to help build the sandcastle. Jack and Jane had a house on the beach, so they were really good when it came to building sandcastles.  They hoped that they could make the sandcastle taller than themselves, but they soon found they needed more help. They asked their cousin Joey to help them build the biggest sandcastle in the world! Joey wasn't the friendliest cousin in the world, but to Billy and Sara's surprise, Joey was happy to help build the sandcastle. Billy, Sara, Jake, Jane and Joey had spent the whole day building the sandcastle, and finally, right before dinner time, they completed it. The sandcastle was huge! It had a river around the castle, and even a bridge to cross the river. It even had a flag at the top, and a wall that went around the castle too!  They were so happy! \tab  The rest of the week at the beach was a lot of fun for Billy and Sara. On Tuesday, they went for ice cream. Sara's ice cream fell and dripped all the way down to her tummy, but Billy gave her some of his. On Wednesday, they watched the fireworks at night. On Thursday, they went swimming all day long, moving like worms in the water. On Friday, they had to go back home. They were sad, so they started counting down the days until next year at the beach!
