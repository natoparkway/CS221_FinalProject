Jake and Carol live next door to a banana farm. One day as they were taking a walk, Jake asked Carol if she could smell the sweet bananas. Carol said yes and that she would love it if the farmer would give them some. Jake's mouth watered at the thought of eating the golden yellow bananas. They then began walking to the farmer's barn to ask him if they could have some. When they arrived they saw a sign that said the farmer would be out until tomorrow night. He was also a singer and would be performing at a school two towns over in Orangeville. Instead of waiting for the farmer to return so that they could ask for some bananas, Jake and Carol began walking around the farm to pick their own.   As he was walking, Jake tripped on a rock. As he tried to stand back up he felt a sharp pain in his leg. He could walk, but it was very painful. Carol let Jake lean on her as they walked home. They knew it was a bad idea to go on the farmer's land without his permission and would never do it again.
