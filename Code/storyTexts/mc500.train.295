Larry the dinosaur was going to go to a dinosaur birthday party that night, and he was very excited, because the party was for him! He was turning 7 years old, which in dinosaur years, that means he was going to be an adult! There were so many different things he was going to do! He knew that there was going to be a moon bounce, and that he was going to get a lot of presents from all of his dinosaur friends, but the thing that he was most excited about, was the cake! Larry's favorite food was cake, and he hoped that they got the right flavor. Larry's favorite flavor was banana. Larry went to school that day and everyone told him happy birthday! When he came home from school, all the lights were out. "Hello?" Larry said, as he came into the house. All of the sudden, the lights went on, and there was everyone! "Happy birthday Larry!" all of his friends shouted. Confetti went everywhere. "Where is the cake?" he asked. "Here it is!" said his mom, and brought out the cake. "It's a chocolate cake, like you wanted!" Larry froze. "I said that I wanted a banana cake." said Larry. He was very sad. "Now the party is going to be no fun." "Oh Larry." said his mom. "Your friends are here, and we worked very hard to set up this party for you! Please at least go spend some time with your friends." Larry was sad, but he tried to have fun. And the more he tried to have fun, the more he liked the party. The moon bounce was fun, and the gifts were very nice. He found out that you can still have fun even when things don't go as planned.
