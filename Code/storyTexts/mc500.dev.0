One sunny morning, Stewart chose to go to the beach. He knew that a rainstorm was going to arrive on Saturday and wanted to enjoy some sun before it arrived.   Stewart laid on his belly and began reading his newspaper. As he was enjoying the sun and the newspaper, he saw a bug crawl across his blanket. At first Stewart thought it was an ant, but the bug was moving too slowly to be an ant. As Stewart leaned in for a closer look, the bug cried out, "Excuse me, sir! Can you help me?" Stewart was surprised and jumped to his feet. "You can talk!" he shouted. "Yes," said the bug. "Please help me! As you might know, there is a rainstorm coming into town. Unfortunately, I do not have a place to call home. I need to find somewhere to sleep before the rain washes me away!" Stewart felt sad. "Gee," he cried. "That sounds terrible!"  Stewart thought about the problem. "Perhaps you can stay at my house," he said. The bug jumped for joy and said, "Oh, that would be wonderful!" The two traveled back to Stewart's house and the bug found a soft spot to sleep.  The next day, the sky had darkened and rain clouds appeared all over town. Just as the news had said, a rainstorm had arrived. When Stewart woke up, he looked for the bug but could not find him. Then, he saw something flying around his house. "Thank you for letting me sleep here last night," said the butterfly. It was the bug! "I knew I could not change into a butterfly if I was out in the rain. I won't forget your kindness." After speaking, the butterfly flew away. Stewart stood in his doorway and shouted, "Goodbye!"
