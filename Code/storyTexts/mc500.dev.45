It was a cold winter day in John's city. It was December and snowing outside. This made John want a bowl of warm soup. John went to the refrigerator to make soup. He looked for the things needed to make the soup. He did not see some items he needed. John needed to go to the grocery store. John wanted to make a list. He found a pencil and paper to make a list. He needed sugar, lettuce, tomatoes and cheese. John wrote down the items. He put the grocery list in his pocket. He then went to the closet to get dressed. John needed a jacket and gloves for the cold weather. He also put his boots on. He remembered to close the front door to his house. John used a key to lock his front door. Then he put the house key is his pocket. The grocery store was around the corner. John walked to the grocery store. He grabbed a grocery basket to put his items in. What did John need? He pulled out his list of items. John found each item and walked back to his house. On this cold winter day, John can make a bowl of warm soup. He has all the items he needed. John was happy.
