There once was a dog named Bruno.  Bruno belonged to a family, the Smiths, but he was most loved by Sarah. Sarah was the youngest child in the house, she lived there with her mom, dad and older brother Fred. Bruno would sleep with Sarah every night, and wake up with her every morning. Together they would eat cheese and ham for breakfast every day! One day after breakfast Sarah was getting ready to go to school, but something scared her! There was a big storm.  Sarah was too scared to go to school with all of the thunder and lighting.  Bruno could tell Sarah was scared, and did the only thing a dog could do, Bruno walked with Sarah to school the whole way so she was no longer scared!
