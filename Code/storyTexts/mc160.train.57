Tim Goes To The Beach  Today was exciting. Tim's mom was taking him and his little sisters, Rebecca and Georgia, to the beach! They were going to go swimming. Then they were also going to have a picnic lunch on the beach. After their picnic lunch, Tim's mom was going to light a campfire and they were going to eat toasted marshmallows.  Tim and his mom and his two little sisters hopped into the van. His little sisters were both very blonde and pretty little girls. They were only 4 years old. Because they lived in the city, they had a short drive to get to the beach. To pass the time, Tim played Eye Spy with his mother as they drove for a bit. Once they had gotten bored with Eye Spy, they played 20 Questions. Tim would think of something, and his mother would ask him questions to try and guess what it was.  When they got to the beach, it was warm, and sunny. The salt water was warm, and the waves lapped up on the shore. It made a lovely noise. It also felt great on Tim's toes, and his little sisters giggled when the waves hit them.  When they had had their fill of swimming, Tim's mom had them sit down to a nice dinner. They ate and ate. They ate macaroni salad. Then they ate some cold chicken. They also had lemon pie for dessert.  Tim's mom started a fire, and they spent the rest of the evening as the sun set eating toasted marshmallows and singing campfire songs. Tim thought it was a very good day.
