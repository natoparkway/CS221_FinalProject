In a far away land known as Board, there was a great man named Pawn. This was a very odd land because the only thing to do was play chess. Pawn did not very much care for chess as he was very bored with it. Another problem Pawn had was that he didn't like some of the other people in this land. They had names like Bishop, Queen, Rook, and Knight. And most of all, there was King. He was the greatest person in Board. One day, during their normal battle, Pawn saw an opening to move to the far end of Board. He almost got hurt by Knight but he got away. Amazingly, when he got to the other end he became as powerful as Queen. With this amazing power, Pawn chose to help keep King safe. All was well until Pawn woke up and knew that it was only a dream. He was still Pawn.
