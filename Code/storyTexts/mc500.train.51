Mrs. Smith liked to deliver her pies with her big hot air balloon.  Mrs. Smith like baking pies of all shapes and sizes. She baked for her neighbors of all ages.  She would bake them up all on Sunday and pile them high in her balloon.  Then she would take off into the sky!  Mr. Jones down the street loved strawberry pie.  He would stand on his roof and catch the pie as the balloon flew by.  Mrs. Kenner liked apple pie.  She would run after the balloon and catch her pie in a big basket.  Bobby and Sue were brother and sister.  They loved chocolate pie.  They would ride their bicycles to the top of a hill.   Mrs. Smith would hand them their pies as she floated by.  Mrs. Smith would throw peach pies down Mr. Tevo's chimney, where they would all land in a big box.  Josh had his dog Rex chase after the pies for him.  Rex would jump high in the air and catch the pie like frisbee!  Everyone would clap as Mrs. Smith rode by and delivered her pies.  Then they would eat and be happy.  Mrs. Smith loved riding her balloon and making her neighbors so happy!
