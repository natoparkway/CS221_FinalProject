One beautiful day, there was a watermelon.  This watermelon was sitting on a bench.  The bench was on the grass.  The grass was in the park.    It was a beautiful place.  But Watermelon had a problem.  It was bored.  All of its friends were busy!  "I'm so bored!" cried Watermelon.  "Come talk to me!" answered a voice from the park.  "But who are you?  Where are you?" asked the watermelon.  "I am a rock.  I am behind you."  Watermelon turned around.  Off in the distance, it saw the rock.  "But Rock, you are so far away!  Can you come closer?"  "No, I can't.  I am a rock.  I am big and flat and heavy.  I am not round like you.  I can't roll to join my friends.  I can't play with everyone like you can.  My shape is no good.  No good at all.  But I want to play!  I want to talk!"  "That is a very sad story, Rock.  But what can I do?"  "Can you roll?"  "Well, yes, yes I can."  "Then roll over here!"  And so Watermelon did.  They talked for a long time.  They sang songs.  They played games.  It was so much fun that Watermelon did not see the weather was changing.  Suddenly a strong wind blew, and it pushed Watermelon away.  "Help!  Help!  I am rolling away, help!"  "Quick, Watermelon!  Get behind me!"  Rock was afraid for his new friend.  Watermelon rolled behind Rock, and there it was protected by Rock from the dangerous wind.  "You saved me!  Thank you"  "No problem!"  "You may be big and flat and heavy.  And maybe you can't roll around like me.  But I am very happy because of that!  I am safe because you are what you are!"
