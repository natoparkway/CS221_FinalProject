Jim was looking up at the sky when he saw it.  He saw a bright light.  It got brighter and brighter.  But after a few seconds, it started getting less bright.  It took him a second to know for sure, but he knew he had seen a shooting star!  This wasn't the first time that Jim had seen something strange in the sky.  It was last year, when he was driving home from work at night.  He saw another light in the sky that night, but it wasn't anything like this one.  The one he saw last year didn't get brighter.  The one he saw last year didn't get less bright.  The one he saw last year was round, and Jim was sure that it was a space ship.  When Jim saw the shooting star tonight, he was even more sure of what he saw last year.  Some people said that the space ship was really a shooting star.  But now that he had seen a real shooting star, he knew for sure that this one was different.  Jim wondered what planet the space ship had come from.
