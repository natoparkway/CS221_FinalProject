Tony was riding his bike home from school.  Then he saw Cindy riding her bike in front of him.    Tony yelled, "Hey, Cindy!"  Then he rode faster to catch up with her.   Cindy said, "Tony! Hey!  Where are you going?"  "I'm going to the empty lot on Maple Street to ride my bike.  The other kids are going to be there.  Do you want to come?"  "Sure," said Cindy.  Tony and Cindy rode to Maple Street, to the empty lot.  The empty lot did not have a house on it.  Instead, it had big hills of dirt, and it had trees cut down on the ground.  There was a low part that became a pond after it rained.  The lot had been empty for a couple of years, because times were bad and the builder couldn't find a buyer for another house.  The kids had ridden their bikes over the hills of dirt, around the cut trees, and through the muddy pond. There were bike trails all over the empty lot.  There were even places where the kids could jump their bikes.    There were three other children riding their bikes at the empty lot when Tony and Cindy arrived: Lana, Billy and Chris.   Cindy said, "I am calling my mom to let her know that I'm here."    Tony said, "That's a good idea.  Can I use your phone when you're done?"  Cindy said "Sure!  Keep it for now.  I'm going to go on the jump path.  I was scared to try it last time.  I don't want to break my phone if I fall.  I'm leaving my backpack here, too."  "Okay." said Tony.  "I'll watch.  You'll do good."
