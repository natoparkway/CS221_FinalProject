Farmer John loves to have parties! Everyone says that he has the best parties in the neighborhood.  He invites all of his friends to his farm and cooks lots of food. Bill is Farmer John's best friend. Bill often comes over to the farm early to help Farmer John cook the food.  They like to make sandwiches, salad, pasta and bacon.  Bill always makes the pasta.  Mary also comes to help Farmer John decorate the farm. Mary likes to put up lots of pink decorations all around the farm. She also brings her friend Jessica. Jessica's favorite colors are blue and green so she brings plenty of blue and green balloons to help make everything look pretty.  After everyone has finished setting up the farm all the guests come over.  Robert is always the first person to show up.  He brings fried chicken and likes to eat a lot of food.  He always eats a plate of bacon first.  When he is done he eats a big plate of pasta.  When everyone else arrives at the party, they play a game in the living room.  Farmer John enjoys playing pin the tail on the unicorn.  Whoever wins the game gets a big piece of cake.  Last time they played, Jessica got the cake.
