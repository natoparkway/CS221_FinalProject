Paul and George wanted to get something to eat for lunch. Sam and Ralph went to school lunch room, but Paul and George wanted to leave and get something outside. They both go to the same school and have the same lunch period, which is how they know each other. They are allowed to leave school for 1 hour for lunch. They get together and rule out pizza, pasta, spicy food and chips. They also want to go somewhere close because they only have an hour. They know there are two places that have burgers and fries close by. Paul loves burgers and George loves fries. Paul says that Great Burger has good burgers. George says that Best Burger has good fries. They now have a problem. "How are we going to pick where we are going to go?" says George. Paul answers "Let's go to Great Burger today and tomorrow let's go to Best Burger." George, being a good friend, says OK. They leave school and go to eat burgers and fries.
