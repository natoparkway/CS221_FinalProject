One upon a time there was a dragon named Jack.  He was large and had big scales, but did not have claws or a mean look on his face like other dragons did.  He also didn't have wings and couldn't fly.  Jack lived near a castle that had a princess trapped in it.  This castle looked and was guarded by an evil dragon named Ryan. The castle was old and dirty.  It wasn't clean or special like many castles are thought to look.  One day Jack thought that he was going to try to save the princess Linda when Ryan was sleeping that night.  After sunset, he slowly walked around and climbed over the back wall.  After passing many sleeping guards, Jack put his nose near the princess's tower window. She climbed out on to it and they ran off.  During their escape, Ryan woke up and started chasing them.  However, he was too sleepy to catch them.  Jack took the princess to a nearby safe town where she thanked him and said goodbye.
