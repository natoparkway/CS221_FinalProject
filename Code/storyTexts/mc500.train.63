Last Saturday was the best day of Timmy's summer. After waking up at nine and turning on his lamp, Timmy ran downstairs, counting the steps as he always did. There were always seven. At the bottom, he jumped over his dog Lucky who was licking himself clean. Timmy took a bite of toast and a sip of the orange juice his mom Suzie had left on the table for him before running outside to check the mail. Before he made it down the steps, he almost tripped on a big package waiting for him. It was here! Timmy's birthday present from his grandmother Betty had arrived. He brought it into the kitchen, where his dad Ryan was waiting for him with a grin on his face. As Timmy tore into the package, he found the greatest present he could have asked for. It was a huge water gun! Timmy immediately filled it up and ran outside to begin playing. His neighbor Maeby came outside with her water hose after eating her sandwich and the two got in a water fight! Soon, Timmy's dad came outside to play too! He brought 11 water balloons. Soon all five of Timmy's friends were playing in the water with each other. Timmy's water gun was the best toy out there. It worked by winding up the handle before firing the water. Soon it was evening and Timmy's dad was firing up the grill to cook hotdogs and hamburgers for Timmy's friends and their families.
