In their small town there are not very many kids. Joe is 8 years old. Nate is 9 years old. They have been the only two boys since they were born. One day Joe saw a White moving truck down the street from his and Nate's tree house. Joe got really excited and told Nate about it. Nate and Joe waited, hoping to see another boy that could join their club.  The Boy's Club started when they were 6 and their dads helped them build their tree house and paint it dark blue.  Joe and Nate both wanted more friends so they could play team games like baseball and football. Nate started day dreaming about playing baseball. Joe started thinking about how fun football would be. They don't like playing board games, Go Fish or Old Maid any more. They were both looking out the window of the tree house, waiting for the family to get out of the dark blue van that pulled up next to the moving truck. The sun's bright yellow light made it hard for the boys to see as the van door opened Nate looked close and yelled out "There are three boys"!  Both boys got really excited and started walking down the street toward the new family. Nate broke into a run and brown dust started coming up from the ground behind his feet. Joe started running to catch up to Nate. They made it to the house quickly and one of the new boys gave a strange look as Nate and Joe both held their knees trying to catch their breath.  A few seconds later Nate stood up and said, "Hi I'm Nate and this is Joe. Do you want to join The Boy's Club"? The boy said, "Sure. Can my brothers be in the club too? And Joe said, "YES!" The boy took a step back and said, "Well, I'm Jacob and my twin's name is Josh. We are 9 and our little brother is Alex. He's 7." Nate and Joe started planning games and made friends quickly with the new boys.
