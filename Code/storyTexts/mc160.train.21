Laura wanted to go to the park and play because she wanted to see her friends. When she got to the park Laura did not see anyone. After looking, she saw her friend George by the basketball hoop. George was playing all by himself. George was happy when he saw Laura. Laura and George played basketball they saw the ice cream man driving in his truck. George asked Laura if she wanted him to buy her an ice cream cone. Laura said she would like him to do that. Laura sat on the bench as George walked to the ice cream truck. Laura looked in the sky and saw a pretty bird flying in a large circle. The bird flew away. George came back with two ice cream cones. One of the ice cream cones had rainbow sprinkles on it. George gave the ice cream cone with sprinkles to Laura. George and Laura sat on the bench and watched a group of boys play football as they ate their ice cream cones. One of the boys broke his leg. When George and Laura were finished with their ice cream, Laura ran home before the street lights came on.
