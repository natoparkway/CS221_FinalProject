Rory the race car loves to race. She loves to take lots of laps around the track. Sometimes, she likes to race her friend Rudy the race truck. Most of the time, she wins. But one very special day, Rudy was feeling very fast. He filled up on gas that morning and was ready for action. He asked Rory to race him. They had to go around the track ten times. Rory could not wait. She thought she could beat him. They sat and the finish line and the light changed from red, to yellow, to green, and the race began! They drove around the track at lightning speed. Faster and faster Rory went. Rory seemed to be losing speed. One of her back tires was feeling strange. She slowed down and frowned. Rudy saw his friend had stopped. He turned around to see what was wrong. Rory told him her tire was about to fall off. He pulled her to the shop and they got the tire fixed. He didn't win the race, but he won a best friend.
