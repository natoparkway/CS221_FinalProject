My cat's name is Buggleton. She is black and white with big green eyes and very long whiskers, like a bug.  When I woke up this morning, my cat was not inside the house. She is allowed outside, and we have a cat door in the kitchen so she can come and go as she pleases. She comes home at night, sleeps in her special box, and is here for breakfast before going outside for new adventures. We can lock the cat door so she can't go outside when we go on vacation. If we go on vacation for more than a few days, my mom comes over to check on her and feed her.   So it was very weird to wake up and see that she was not home for her morning food! My husband and neighbor and I called for her, but she did not come. Guess where she was? Trapped in the garage overnight!
