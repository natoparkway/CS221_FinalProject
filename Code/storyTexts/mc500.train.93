All the animals were having a picnic. Turtle brought hotdogs for everyone.  All the animals came to make their hotdogs.  Rabbit put ketchup on his hotdog.  Duck put mustard on his hotdog.  Bear put ketchup and mustard on his hotdog.  Turtle and Fox did not put ketchup or mustard on their hotdog. Goose looked at the hotdogs.  He did not like hotdogs at all.  He was very hungry.  He looked around for something else to eat.  Duck had brought chips, but Goose did not like chips.  Bear had brought salad, but Goose did not like salad.  Fox had brought apples, but Goose did not like apples. Rabbit brought carrots, but Goose did not like carrots. Goose looked around for something that he liked.  Then he saw something near the edge of the meadow.  It was a bunch of red strawberries.  Goose liked strawberries very much.  He took a basket and gathered up as many strawberries as he could and brought them to the picnic.  Everyone was happy, and Goose was not hungry any more.
