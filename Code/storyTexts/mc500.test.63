Bill was cleaning his room and giving away some of the toys that he no longer used. Bill put a duck and a truck in the pile to give away. He added a car and a blanket and a push mower to the give a way pile. Bill liked the car and took it out of the give a way pile, so he did not give the car away. Bill put a broken phone into the trash can. Bill also threw away two books and some used crayons. As Bill was cleaning his room his mother came in to help. Bill and his mother cleaned most of the room. When they were almost finished Bill's father also came in to help. Bill picked up the duck and the truck and took it to the car. Bill's father picked up the blanket and the push mower and took them out to the car. Bill's mother carried the trash can down to the large garbage can outside. Bill's room was all cleaned.
