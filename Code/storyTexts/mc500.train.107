Ferra the car was sad. Her wheels were dirty. Her doors were dirty. Her hood was dirty and her windows were dirty too. There was mud from splashing in puddles. There was grass stuck to the mud from playing tag in the yard. And there were leaves from jumping in leaf piles. It was a busy day. Now Ferra wanted a nap. But if she went to sleep in the garage it would get all dirty.  Ferra's mom said 'Come here. I can give you a bath and you can be squeaky clean' So Ferra let her mom give her a nice bath with big bubbles.  When she was done, Ferra went to take a nap in the garage, all happy and squeaky clean.
