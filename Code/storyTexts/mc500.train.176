On a Monday, a mother was in the kitchen cooking ham for the family.  She was in quite the hurry because she had to pick the kids up from school.  Without knowing, she stuck a spoon in the ham and put the ham in the oven.  She wasn't paying attention because of being in a hurry and also because the dog was playing with a ball.  The ball flew past her head as she had finished putting the ham in the oven.  She yelled at the dog and made him play with the ball outside.  She saw clouds in the sky as she let the dog out.  Seeing that the clouds were so pretty that she wanted to take a picture of them.  She got her camera and took a few pictures as the dog played happily in the yard.
