There was a young woman who had a baby. She was very young. She had to learn how to feed the baby right. The doctor helped her with this. The doctor helped her with many things. Yesterday, the doctor had helped her try and teach the child to use the toilet. Today, she puts a bib on the baby to try to feed her. She tries to feed it with a frog shaped spoon. She tries to feed her a banana. She tries a rhyme, to get the child to have fun. The rhyme is about the cat that jumped over the moon. The doctor watches with a smile on his face. The doctor has a beard. The baby likes to play with the doctor's beard. The baby also likes to play with her rattle. Her rattle is shaped like a bull. It is a loud rattle. The baby still makes a mess, but she is drier than yesterday. The doctor says it is a good job.
