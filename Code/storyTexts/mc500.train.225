One day, Jane and Mike went to the zoo with their mother. As soon as they arrived, Jane said she wanted to go see the bears and the lions. Mike didn't want to see them at all, he wanted to see the monkeys. Their mother told them that they can see all of the animals, but they have to start with the sneaky snakes. After going around to some of the animals, Mike was happy to finally see the monkeys. As soon as they started to watch the monkeys, they started dancing by the window in front of Mike, Jane, and their mother. "Look! Mike," their mother said, "those monkeys are dancing for you!" and Mike watched them happily dance and dance! When they stopped dancing, their mother told Jane it was time to see some scary lions and bears. Jane wasn't scared at all, she knew they weren't going to get her. Jane bravely went to the section with the lions and watched them roaring at her and Mike. Mike got scared and hid behind his mom. Jane was happy watching the lions. Next was the bears, but they were all asleep by the time they got to see them. At the end of the day, Mike said he loved the monkeys the best, Jane said she loved the lions. Both, Jane and Mike, said they loved the zoo.
