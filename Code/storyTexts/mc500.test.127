Grace was very excited about Halloween. She wanted to dress up as a beautiful princess. Her brother Max wanted to be a zebra. Their mother made their costumes and got them ready to go trick-or-treating. The three of them walked through their neighborhood and saw all of the other children in their costumes. They saw their friends Mary and her sister Melissa. Mary was dressed as a princess, like Grace. The two girls said hello and looked over each other's costumes. Grace had a purple dress with a pink hat; Mary had a pink dress with a purple hat. The two girls switched hats so their hats matched their costumes. They said goodbye and went on trick-or-treating.  Max and Grace walked up to the first house on their block and rang the doorbell. A large man dressed as a doggy opened the door and gave them a bunch of candy. They thanked him and moved on. The next house had a mummy standing on the front porch. They knew it was a costume, but they were too afraid to go up to him and ask for candy, so they moved on to the next house. After they had walked the whole neighborhood and filled their bags with candy, Grace and Max went home with their mother. They dumped the candy out on the dining room table and began to eat it. "You had a nice Halloween, didn't you?" their mother asked them. Max and Grace smiled and said yes, they had.
