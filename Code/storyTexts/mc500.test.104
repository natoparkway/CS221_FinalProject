A lamb named Lana woke up on an early Monday morning. After taking a shower and getting dressed, she chose to start making something to eat. In the end, she made eggs, toast and coffee for her breakfast. While she was eating, she was called on the telephone by her good friend Drake the dog. They chose to meet up after Lana finished eating so they could take a walk around the park. Drake also told her that their friend, Terry the turtle, would not be joining them. As soon as Lana finished cleaning her dishes, she heard a knock on her door - it was Drake! She threw on her coat and went outside, so they could start their walk. In the end, they spent a few hours walking along the park's sidewalk, until ending up back near Lana's house. "Let's do this again soon!" Drake said, as he wagged his tail. "Sure!" Lana said, as she walked back into her home. Lana made a light dinner, cleaned up, then chose to hop into bed. She soon fell asleep.
