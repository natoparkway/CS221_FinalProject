There once was a small boy who liked to wiggle.  He would wiggle everywhere he went. He would wiggle during supper when he was eating his food.  He would wiggle down the winding path outside his house. He could wiggle his right knee when he walked, and that gave his wiggle even more wiggle.  One day, his grandpa was watching the boy wiggle.  His grandpa was old and liked to cough.  He had a long beard that was grey at the top. He was tired of watching the boy wiggle, and thought the boy was wiggling around a little too much. So, his grandpa gave the boy a pea and told him it was a magic pea. He said the magic pea would stop his wiggle. The boy started roaring with laughter. He didn't believe a pea could stop his wiggle.  The grandpa put the pea in a little square bag and tied it around the boy's waist.  The boy tried to wiggle, but he couldn't wiggle at all. All he could do was walk straight. That was no fun. What good was a boy if he couldn't wiggle when he wanted?  The grandpa coughed and smiled. He enjoyed watching the boy not wiggle any more.
