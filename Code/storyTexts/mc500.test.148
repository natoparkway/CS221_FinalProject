Greg and his mother were building a racing car. They were going to enter it into a race on Saturday. They began building the racing car on Monday. First, they had to build the body of the car. Greg wanted it to look like a strawberry! So they colored it red and put little dots all over it. On Tuesday, Greg's father helped them put the wheels on the racing car. His mother had to hold the car's body up when his father put the wheels on. On Wednesday, Greg and his mother colored in the number 8 on the car. This was Greg's lucky number! On Thursday, Greg and his mother tested the racing car at a park near the river. It went really fast! On Friday, Greg and his mother and father were outside in their backyard, still practicing with the racing car, making sure it went as fast as it could. Greg really wanted to win the race! On Saturday, Greg and his mother went to the race. It was being held on the track at his school. They put their racing car on the track, and a man started to count down from 10. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, GO! Greg pushed his car forward as fast as he could! It reached the finish line before everyone else! Greg won the race!
