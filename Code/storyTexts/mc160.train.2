Hawthorne rolled over in bed and looked around the room.  He let out a breath. His eyes were half-closed as he shoved the covers back from his bed, and moved towards the door.  He knew that he had to check on Kate, if he did nothing else. She was ill, with a heart problem, and he worried about her all the time.  They both lived in a home for orphans, and he had since his parents had died, when he was the age of four. He had taken care of Kate as if she were his sister ever since. He wandered to her room sitting himself by her on her bed, shoving her hair from her face.  She moved on the bed as he pulled her into his arms, "Kate." He said into her ear, "It's time to wake up." He pressed a kiss to her head, and her eyes opened.  "Hawthy?" She said, her nickname for him moving from her lips.  "Yea." He moved her hair.  "I want to go outside today," she said, and he nodded in response.  "If you are up to it, I won't stop you", he told her, and she smiled.  "Thanks Hawthy", she said.  It wasn't long until she fell back to sleep.
