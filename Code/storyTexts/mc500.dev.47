There once was a little monkey who lived in a zoo. He was a tiny brown monkey, smaller than all of the others. He was quieter than the others too. He was so quiet, in fact, that his mommy monkey made him wear a small blue bell around his neck so that she could find him. Even when the little monkey was very quiet, whenever he moved, the bell would jingle and his mother could find him.  One day, this little monkey had been running around under the yellow sun for a long time, with his bell going "jingle jingle." He started to feel tired. But the other monkeys were still having fun and making a lot of noise. They were yelling and banging things together. The little monkey wanted to find somewhere quiet.  Finally, he knew what to do: he took off his blue bell. He hung it on a branch. Then he sneaked out of his cage in the zoo. He waited. He was very quiet and small. He waited until a young girl came walking through the zoo. She was with her mother and father. Then he jumped into her red backpack. He was so small that she didn't know he was there. The girl and her mother and father got in their car and went home.  When the girl got home, she set down her backpack. Her brother thought he saw her backpack moving. Her sister thought she heard something. But nobody knew that a tiny, sleepy monkey had come home from the zoo. He was happily sleeping in the girl's backpack in her quiet house, away from all the other noisy monkeys.
