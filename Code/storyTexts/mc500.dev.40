I stepped inside my mother's car and dropped my backpack on the floor as my face filled with excitement. Today's the day that we're going to the candy store and picking out a new treat to have after dinner. Some people may like going to the movies, or the game room, or even to parks, but going to the candy store once a week and getting to see all the different colors and taste all the different treats is my favorite activity. As soon as we pull up, she tells me to not run around too much inside, but I'm so excited I barely hear her. She opens the door and we walk inside where the clerk first welcomes us. Since we do this each week, he calls me by my name of Trevor and says that he's come up with a few candies for me to try.   I walk over to the table and see three types of M&M's laid out. He knows I'm not a big fan of peanuts so he left out the peanut kind, instead giving me mint flavored, cookies 'n creme flavored, and white chocolate flavored. They all taste great and the clerk asks which I like the most. It takes me a bit to choose, but I finally choose the Mint as this week's choice. He rings us up at the front desk and says that since we buy from his shop so much, he's going to give us a sale, so we think it'll be a nickel or a dime or even a quarter off. Actually, the clerk ends up cutting it half off! We thanked him and went on our way as I tried not to eat all the way home.
