One day, a pink moon was looking down at an empty sand land. Although the pink moon could see all the lizards and cacti in the empty sand land, nobody could see the moon! The pink moon felt so lonely. So, the pink moon called on the sun for help. The great sun was very busy high in the sky, for it was his job to shine over the sand land, and it was hard to get his attention. So the moon wiggled closer and closer to the sun every second. The second turned to hours as the pink moon inched toward his friend, slowly moving across the sky. Finally, the sun saw the moon and asked, "Pink moon! What are you doing here? Don't you know the sky is my home during the day? Your time is coming soon enough. Look, I'm falling now toward my bed on the end of the earth..." But the pink moon could not be stopped and kept moving toward the great sun. "But great sun, I become so lonely during the day when your light is so bright the animals in the sand land can't see me. Please let me join your light during the day this once!" By this time, the great sun and pink moon were only inches apart. The great sun said, "Though by day you disappear, I always remember you are here. Come to me now. Stand in front of me, and show the sand land your shine!" So the pink moon inched in front of the great sun. At first, covering part of the sun's circle, then more, then...a complete covering of the sun! The pink moon was shining with the power and light of the sun! All the lizards, cacti and every animal stood still in awe of the daytime pink moon! But at that time, the sun slipped away, saying "Farewell, pink moon. We have to do this again!" And so, every few years, the sun and moon come together to show the pink moon's is always with us, even in the day time .
