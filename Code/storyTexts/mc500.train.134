A tiger named Timmy and Bear named Buster were going for a walk in the park by the river and were going to go swim later. As Timmy was running through a field in the park he came upon a small hamster with a broken leg. The hamster looked like it had somewhere to go but couldn't make it because of its leg. Timmy called Buster over to come talk to the hamster and see if there was anything they could do to help. As they talked, Timmy and Buster started to become good friends with the hamster. They found out his name was Henry. Henry was on his way to the river for a drink of water when a mean horse ran by and without looking at where he was going stepped on his leg and broke it. Luckily for Henry Busters mom was a nurse and after watching her work for many years Buster knew how to set a broken bone and fix it. After Buster fixed Henry's leg he picked him up and put him on Timmy's back and they all went to the river to get some water. They all were best friends for the rest of their lives and played together.
