Joe was in his bedroom. He was reading a book that his teacher gave him. The book was titled, "Everything You'd Want to Know About Fish." He was reading the book because he was interested in learning more about fish. Joe thought reading the book was fun. He liked to imagine himself swimming with fish he read about in the book. Also, he liked looking at the pictures.  Joe's mother called him. Joe closed the book, and went downstairs. He asked his mother, "Do you need something?"  And his mother said, "Joe, it's time for dinner."
