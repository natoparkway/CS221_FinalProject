One day when driving home John saw a group of bicycle racers riding down the road. When they stopped at a store he pulled over to talk to them. Their names were David, Mark, and Sam. When he asked them how they got into racing they each had a different story to tell. Sam started with his dad when he was much younger. Mark started when he met Sam, who was racing. David started when he saw a race on TV. John was very interested in learning to race bicycles like the three men he met. So he asked them where he could buy a bike like theirs, and how much would it cost. Sam said he would give him his old bike for free. Mark told him of a store nearby, and David told him of a store on the web. John said goodbye to the racers so that they could keep going on their ride. John then went home and left Sam a note so that he could pick up his old bike. He then went to his desk to look up some stuff on bike racing. He was so excited his mother heard him from the other room shouting about wheels. He looked into the safety parts of bike riding including the wrong time to ride and the stuff he would need like, a helmet and horn.
