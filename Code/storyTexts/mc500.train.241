Mitchell and his brother, Graham are biking to the store to buy lemons.  They want to make a lemonade stand for their friends.  In order to do this, they need to buy lemons, sugar, and cups from the store.  While they are at the store, they run into their friends Jimmy and Justin.  Jimmy and Justin are also brothers.  Mitchell and Graham stop to talk to their friends for a bit before they go back to their shopping.  After filling up their basket with the items they need to make lemonade, they go to the front of the store to pay.  Once they get home, they start making lemonade and set out their table by the sidewalk.  They talk to a few of their neighbors as they walk buy and some of them buy some lemonade. After sitting outside for some time, they think about making a sign to let the neighbors know that they have lemonade for sale.  Mitchell gets the markers and Graham gets the sign.  They work together to make the sign.  After putting the sign in front of the table, they find people want much more lemonade.  Later Jimmy and Justin stop by and buy some lemonade.  Mitchell and Graham talk to their friends about things that Jimmy and Justin would need to do to make their own stand.  After their friends leave, Mitchell and Graham count their money and choose to split the money.  Each of the boys put the money in their piggy banks.
