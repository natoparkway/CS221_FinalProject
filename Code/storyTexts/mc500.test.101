Leah and the Big Yellow Dog  Leah was very happy.  It was a bright, sunny day and Mommy was taking her to Leah's favorite place.  Leah loved the play park near the water!      Mommy parked the car and Leah ran out right away and climbed the big slide.  Up she went and then down.  Two other kids saw Leah and ran over and slid down, too.  Leah was laughing and happy.  Suddenly a big, yellow dog walked into the park.  This was really a friendly dog, and only wanted someone to play with.  But Leah was scared of dogs.  Leah didn't see the dog at first.  Leah started walking toward the swing, and the dog followed Leah.  Before Leah sat on the on the swing, she turned around and saw the dog smiling at her.  The dog looked goofy standing there with its mouth open.  Leah was scared.  She started yelling and screaming.  This only made the dog look confused.  The dog then began sounding out with Leah, barking and howling itself.  They were a sight to see with Leah screaming and the dog howling.  Mommy went over and took Leah away from the dog, but mommy could barely keep herself from laughing.  The dog's master came and got the dog, and Leah went back to playing.  "Some dogs are nice," Mommy told Leah.
