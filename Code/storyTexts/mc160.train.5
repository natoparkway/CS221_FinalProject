One sunny day, Martha went on a walk through the park. While walking, she noticed something strange. No one was outside. She was the only person at the park. "How strange, where is everyone?" she thought. Martha looked everywhere. She looked inside the restrooms, under the benches, and even at the top of the slide. She was confused. Usually, she would see her friends playing with each other. She started walking again when one of her friends popped up, surprising her. Her friend asked her, "Why are you outside?" Martha asked what she meant, and explained that she always came out to the park to play. Her friend then looked at her strangely and asked, "Didn't Stephan invite you to his party?" Martha hadn't known that Stephan was holding a party. She was sad that he hadn't invited her. She walked back home, upset.
