A man named Albert had the choice to build a tree house, a garage, a desk, or a cabinet.  Albert chose to build something big to share with his kid, so he wanted to make a tree house.  Albert had to choose what kind of stuff to make the tree house out of.  Wood is popular, but splinters would hurt his son.  Metal is very strong, but it would also be very hard to use.  Plastic is not expensive, but it also bends a lot. The last choice was to give up, but Albert really wanted to do this for his son.  It would make him very happy.  Albert ended up choosing wood, as it was the most popular choice.  Albert went to the store to buy nails, tools, and wood, but forgot to buy glue.  He had to go back there and he finally had everything he needed.  He got started and it was very hard.  One hour went by, then two, then three, then four.  Finally, on the fifth hour, Albert finally finished the tree house.  His son ran out and jumped into his dad's arms.  They both looked at it, and Albert's son gave his dad a kiss for all the hard work he had done.  Albert looked at the tree house he had built and was very happy.  He had done it all by himself, and he was happy to see his son being so happy as well. They would have a long summer of playing together in the tree house that Albert built.  It was one of the best tree houses ever!
