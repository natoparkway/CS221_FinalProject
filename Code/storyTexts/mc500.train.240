A guy with brown hair was named Josh. His daughter was Maggie and her favorite activity was riding her yellow bike. Sometimes she would put a card in the spokes of the wheel. This made her bike sound much faster than it was going. Once when she was riding down a hill, she went too fast and hit a trashcan. Other than having a bad smell, she was ok but was afraid to tell her father what had happened. So she told a lie. When she looked her father in the eye, he saw that there was more to the story. When he found out Maggie was not being truthful, he had to give her a spanking. He told her that telling lies is wrong, but he loves her.
