John Bill Bob lived on a boat in the sea.  He went all around the world, to see what he could see.  In America, he went to a farm.  There, he saw a barn.  He had some milk from a cup.  The cup was big; Cow filled it up!  In Africa, he went to the wild.  He saw a tiger and heard it growl.  From the growl, he ran away.  He wanted to live another day!  In England he went riding on a horse.  He had so much fun, up in the North!  The horse grew tired; they stopped to rest.  It was time to move on, it was for the best.  In Italy, he wanted a sandwich.  Problem was, he could not choose which!  The tuna salad?  The ham and cheese?  It was too much, he had to leave.  In Siberia, he spent a winter.  The houses were frozen, he could not enter!  Where did he sleep, what did he do?  We do not know, not me, not you!  John Bill Bob lived on a boat in the sea.  He'd gone all around the world, but the sea was where he wanted to be.
