There once was a woman named Mary. Mary's best friend was a dog named Buddy. Mary and Buddy went everywhere together. They had a lot in common. They both liked to play games like fetch and hide and seek. Neither of them liked to take a bath. Mary and Buddy enjoyed smelling flowers and eating hamburgers. But they also were very different from one another. For one thing, Buddy was a dog! Buddy liked talking to strangers and visiting new places. But Mary was shy. One day a man named John came by. Mary hid behind a tree when she saw him. Buddy tried to tell her it was okay, but she was too scared to listen. So Buddy went out to say hello to John. John was very nice and he liked the same games as Buddy. Mary watched Buddy chase after a ball John threw. She could tell John was a nice man. She wanted to play too. Buddy saw her watching and led his new friend over to Mary. John waved to Mary and brought her a flower. Mary smiled at him. She thought he was very kind and she wasn't as nervous as before. Buddy barked happily. Yay for new friends!
