Once there was a young boy named Bret who had a cat named Wolfgang.  The boy had really wanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked to blow things down and they snored.  So the boy had to call his cat Wolfie.  He had also thought about naming his cat Sir Purrsalot.  Bret himself planned to become a knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought Sir Purrsalot sounded like a good name for his brother knight.  The difficulty there was that Wolfie didn't purr a lot.  He purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.  Plus Bret's mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the bathroom and they clanked.  So Bret was left with a cat named Wolfgang.  The neighbors gave him strange looks when he stood in the front yard in the evening and yelled "Wolfie!  Here Wolfie!!!", to get Wolfgang to come in for the night.  But Bret didn't care what anyone else thought.  He had a Wolfie and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.
