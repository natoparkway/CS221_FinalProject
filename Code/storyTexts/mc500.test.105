Once upon a time there was a small boy named Jeremy. Jeremy was very shy and did not have a lot of friends. One day, when he was sitting outside his house, he saw a small cat hiding around his house. The cat was under his porch. This cat was yellow. Yellow was Jeremy's favorite color. Jeremy went under the porch and caught the yellow cat. Jeremy was very happy when he caught the cat. A new cat meant he had a new friend to play with. Jeremy and the cat played every day. Jeremy loved his cat and they ran happily around the neighborhood. They played in his friend's front yard, in the street, and even by the garbage can. Jeremy loved his cat and the yellow cat loved Jeremy. The cat lived with Jeremy, along with his orange and black cat. Jeremy had lots of cats and he wants to get a blue cat. Jeremy's cats were his best friends and he was their favorite person.
