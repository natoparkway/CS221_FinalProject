Juno was a very playful dog but she was also very disobedient.     One afternoon Juno was out in the front yard playing tag with Sasha the kitten, when Billy came to fetch her for her bath.  Juno did not like baths very much and she ran away every time Billy got close to her.  Billy soon got tired of Juno's game, so he left her in the garden hoping she would keep running around and tire herself out.   Sasha the kitten followed Billy and Juno was surprised to find herself alone, she had hoped Billy would keep on playing this fun game.   To pass the time she watched some birds building a nest in a tree, Juno was so bored she even tried to play hide and seek with George, the parrot.  Finally, since there was nobody to play with Juno laid down to take a nap. A little later Billy came back out into the yard to fetch Juno.   What Billy didn't know was, Juno had been sleeping since he left and she was ready for another game of catch me if you can, her favorite game.  Juno took off running as soon as she saw Billy.   Billy sat down on the grass to wait.  Billy found a ball and started to throw it for Juno to fetch.  Billy kept on throwing the ball and Juno kept on bringing it back until  Juno dropped the ball and lay down on the grass, panting, tired out.      Billy quickly slipped the collar and leash on her.   Billy got Juno on her feet and the two of them walked round to the back yard where the family were sitting outside enjoying the sunshine.   Billy's father called him to come and enjoy some ice cream with them but Billy said no, he'd rather get Juno's bath time over with and then he could enjoy his ice cream.   Billy knew he had to hurry or his brothers Allen and Greg would finish the Rocky Road ice cream which was Billy's favorite. Billy tied Juno's leash to the fence and then he brought the hose over and switched it on.  Juno   immediately tried to run away but she had no choice but to stay there and let Billy soak her.   Billy quickly added soap to Juno's coat and soon she was covered in soapy suds.   Soon Billy once again turned the hose on Juno to rinse all the soap out of her coat.   The last thing to be done was to rub Juno down with a towel and dry her off Once Billy had finished he took the collar and leash off and Juno lay down in the sun happy that bath time was over once again.   Billy went to join the rest of the family and his father said he could choose between Chocolate Chip, Caramel Delight, Cookies and Cream or Rocky Road ice cream. Billy quickly said he wanted the Rocky Road and his father put down a large dish of the ice cream and said 'good job son'
