Ralph the bee wanted to go visit his friend George the fly. George lived very far away, it would a long trip for Ralph. Ralph first flew over a jungle, in the jungle he met a nice tiger by the name of Benny. Benny wanted to play but Ralph had no time, he still had a long way to go. Then Ralph flew by a lake. At the lake he met a cowboy. The cowboy was named Walter. Walter was letting his horse get a drink of water from the lake. The horse drank a lot and when he was done he let out a huge burp. Ralph waved goodbye to Walter and his horse. Ralph then stopped for lunch, he had some bread he brought with him from home. While he was sitting when all of the sudden a pig walked up to him. He did not get the pigs name, because the pig could only say oink. Finally, after a long trip, Ralph finally got to the house of George the fly. George wanted to play, but Ralph was too tired. So Ralph went to sleep.
