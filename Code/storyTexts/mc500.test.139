A little mouse lived in a little house.  The mouse would hurry along the walls at night looking for food.  Sometimes he'd find frosting from a cake.  Those were good days.  Sometimes he'd find paint from a paint can.  Those were bad days.  Either way, he'd always get scared whenever the phone rang.  It was so loud and made him jump.  Yesterday he tripped over a wire because he wasn't looking where he was going. The television was on full volume so no one saw it.  He loved running around in the kitchen.  There was always leftover food on a spoon in the sink.  Sometimes it was dried food and he'd have to scrape it off with his claws.  It still tasted good to the mouse.  He was so happy there were no other animals living around there.  He had heard a piggy ate a lot more than a mouse.  He didn't want to have to fight a piggy over food.  Life was really good for this little mouse.
