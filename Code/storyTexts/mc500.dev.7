Jenny was standing on a rock.  Suddenly, she had to sneeze.  After she sneezed, she walked away.  She finally got to the park and saw her daddy.  Her daddy gave her some milk.  Jenny drank the milk in a big hurry.  She loved milk.  She walked over and turned a switch.  She walked to the lake.  Jenny was in a big hurry and went really fast.  She got to the lake and sat down.  Jenny began thinking.  Jenny wanted to go on a trip to Florida.  Jenny did not want to go someplace cold.  Jenny did not want to go to the moon.  Jenny did not want to go to France.  Jenny stood up to fold her towel.  She never folded her shirts or pants.  Jenny would start her art for her aunt in a few hours.  She knew she would use a lot of time making that art.  Her aunt would love the art.
