There were 2 best friends named Sam and Jenny. They were not friends with Kimmi, a girl in the same class. And they were not friends with Joe. Joe was not their friend because he didn't talk to Sam and Jenny. Joe did not talk to anyone.  Kimmi talked to everyone, but she did not keep secrets she was told and she said  bad things about the people around her all the time. No one liked her. Everyone thought she was mean. One day, Sam and Jenny were playing with their puppy near a big tree when they found Kimmi sitting under the tree crying. Kimmi was sad that no one wanted to be her friend. Sam and Jenny felt bad for Kimmi. Jenny told Kimmi  she would have a lot of friends if she didn't say such mean things about people. Sam said that was not true, because Joe did not talk about people and he had no friends.  Sam and Jenny thought about it a long time. Sam and Jenny brought Kimmi to meet Joe. Kimmi and Joe became friends soon and Kimmi learned not to say mean things about people. Everyone was happier.
