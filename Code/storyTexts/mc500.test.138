Susie woke up early on Saturday morning. She was very happy because her cousin, Mary, was coming to visit today. She was also happy about the new kittens. They were only a few weeks old, and so cute!   Susie ran into the kitchen. Her mother was cooking breakfast.  "I can't wait to show Mary the new kittens," Susie announced to her mother. "Do you think her mother is going to allow her to have one?"  "I don't know," Susie's mom answered. "I hope so. Six kittens - that's too many! I only want to keep two kittens. She is going to be here soon."  Susie hurried through breakfast and ran outside to wait on Mary. She jumped up and down with excitement when she saw a car turn into the driveway. Susie ran toward the car as Mary opened the door.   "We have new kittens," Susie announced with a smile. "Mom says you can take one home."  "Can I Mommy, please," Mary asked her mother.  "I need to think about it," said Mary's mother.  "Come on!" Susie said and ran toward the barn where the kittens were. Mary ran after her.  Mary and Susie played with the kittens all day.
