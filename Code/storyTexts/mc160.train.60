Luke takes his dog for a walk. Luke has many pets. He has a turtle named Bob. He has a cat named Freckles. He has a bird named squeaky. The dog is named Sparky. Sparky loves to go on walks with Luke. Sparky jumps around in front of the doorway.  Luke puts on his hat, coat, and gloves because it is chilly outside. Luke puts a leash around Sparky's neck. Luke opens the door and they are ready to go. Luke walks up Vine Street to the stop sign. The stop sign is red. Luke looks both ways and then walks across Willow street with Sparky. Luke and Sparky walk up the hill.  At the top of the hill, Luke and Sparky turn left. They walk downhill on First Street. At the bottom of the hill, they see a small pond. The pond is on Elm Street. Sparky is very happy. Swimming in the pond are ducks. There are white ducks and brown ducks. There are baby ducks, too. Sparky walks all around the pond. Luke watches the ducks as they swim around the pond. When it is time to go, Luke leads Sparky back to the sidewalk. It is warmer and Luke takes off his hat and coat. They walk home.
