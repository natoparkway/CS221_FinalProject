One morning, Justin woke up very excited. He was excited because it was his birthday. He went downstairs to eat breakfast.   When he got downstairs his mom said, "Happy Birthday."  "Thank you!" Justin said. "Am I going to have lots of presents?" he asked his mom.   "Yes, Justin. When your friends come over for your birthday party you'll get lots!"  "Hooray!" Justin said, eating his breakfast.   Later that day, Justin's friends came over for his birthday party, and they brought over lots of presents.   They ate cake and ice cream. They played games like tag and played with a football.   After they were done playing Justin got to open his presents. He saw lots of presents. Red ones, blue ones, tall ones, round ones.   "Thank you!" Justin said, as he started to open his presents. He got a basketball, a robot toy, a new bike and some super hero toys!  After all of Justin's friends left, Justin fell asleep very fast because of the exciting day he had and he was happy he got all of those nice things.
