Andy was a small boy who, like many small boys, loved to play.  He would play outside.  He would play in his basement.  He would play in his room.  When he played, he would play with lots of things.  Sometimes he played with blocks.  Sometimes he played with cards.  Sometimes he would even play with his sister's dolls.  One day, Andy became bored.  "Maybe I'll play outside," said Andy.  He tried to play outside, but it didn't seem right.  "I know," said Andy, "maybe I'll play in the basement."  So he tried to play in his basement, but that didn't seem right either.  "I guess I can play in my room," said Andy.  So he went to his room to play, but he still felt bored.    "Maybe I need to play with something different," said Andy.  So he tried to play with his blocks, but he was still bored.  "I'll play with my cards," said Andy, but they weren't fun either.  "I'll play with my sister's dolls," said Andy, but he kept being bored.    Andy was starting to get sad, and then his sister Angie came in and asked, "Do you want to play, Andy?"  "Yes," said Andy.  And they played with blocks, and dolls, and cards.  And they had fun.  As it turns out, all Andy needed was somebody to play with.
