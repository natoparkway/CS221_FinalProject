Johnny was in his backyard.  He held a big basket full of clean clothes for his mother to hang.  A little spotted dog ran into their backyard.  He jumped up and grabbed a sock from Johnny's basket!  He ran as fast as he could and disappeared into the bushes.  "I must get that sock back!" Johnny said.  "That sock is my favorite!"  He ran into the bushes after the little spotted dog.  Johnny saw Mr. Wilson in the next yard over cooking at his grill.  "Mr. Wilson," Johnny said.  "Did you see a dog with a sock?"  "I sure did!" Mr. Wilson said.  "The little dog ran around and around and then ran into the next yard!"  Johnny ran after the dog into the next yard.  He saw Mrs. Tomly reading a book on a chair.  "Mrs. Tomly," Johnny said.  "Did you see a dog with a sock?"  "I sure did!" Mrs. Tomly said.  "The little dog ran around and around then ran into the next yard!"  Johnny ran after the dog into the next yard.  There, he saw a cat laying on a table.  "Mr. Cat," Johnny said.  "Did you see a dog with a sock?"  The cat opened one eye.  Then it pointed to the next yard over with his tail.  Johnny ran into the next yard.  He saw Mrs. Han sitting on a chair petting the little spotted dog.  The dog had his sock.  "That is my sock!" Johnny said.  Mrs. Han smiled and gave Johnny back his sock.  "Sparky here only wanted to play."  Johnny petted Sparky.  "I want to play too," he said to the dog.  "As long as you do not steal my socks!"  Sparky barked happily.  He and Johnny played the rest of day together.
