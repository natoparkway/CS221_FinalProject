There once was a business man named Red. Red owned his own business. He had his very own movie store. There are food stores, sporting goods stores, and even radio stores, but Red owned a movie store. Many people visited his movie store and watched a lot of movies. There were many different types of movies in his store. He had funny movies about dogs. He had scary movies about monsters. He had action movies about cops and even had silly movies about grown-ups. His movie store was known for its paint job. The paint job was the color red. It was not blue, purple, or yellow. The people in the town loved his red movie store and Red the movie store guy loved them. He gave them all the movies they could ever want. They kept watching his movies and soon Red opened another movie store. Red had two red movie stores and people loved watching his movies. Red even had popcorn at his movie store. He did not have ice cream, candy, or soda pop and this made people very sad.
