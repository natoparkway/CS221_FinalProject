Mary was a little girl who loved to sew. She liked to sew dresses, shirts, and skirts but Mary hated to sew quilts. She didn't like anything about sewing quilts and blankets because it took too long. One quilt or blanket took a week to make, when a skirt or shirt took one night! Mary's mother didn't understand why Mary didn't like to sew quilts and blankets because Mary's mother loved to!  Mary was a normal little girl even if her friends didn't think so all the time. Mary's friends liked to play games and play outside but all Mary liked was to sew. She woke up and she began to sew. She only stopped to eat and use the bathroom. Mary's father was very worried about Mary. He said that little girls needed to laugh and play, not sew all the time.   One day Mary's father took Mary's sewing things and gave them to the poor children. "No more sewing, Mary!" He said. He wanted her to go laugh and play with her friends instead of sew but instead of going outside to play she ran into her room and cried. Mary was very sad that she couldn't sew any more. Soon her friends came over to see why Mary hadn't come over to play like her father said she would. When they saw her crying on her bed they had to think of a way to cheer her up. Billy said that maybe they could let her sew at their houses. Abby thought it was a great idea. So then all Mary's friends bought sewing things with their money so that Mary would be happy again. When Mary's father saw Mary go to one of her friend's house he was very happy. Soon everyone was happy again.
