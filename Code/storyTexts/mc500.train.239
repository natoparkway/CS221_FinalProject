There was a cat. Her name was Maggie.  Maggie was a large cat. She was not tall but rather round. She was happy most of the time. Maggie lived with a family that loved her very much. They all lived in the city together downtown. They were no other animals that lived with them. They lived in an apartment. Maggie was lucky because she and her family lived on the ground floor and they had a big back yard that had a fence. This meant she got to go outside and play!  Maggie's family loved her very much. She knew this because they took such good care of her. She had her very own purple cat bed. She loved her bed, and purple. This was her favorite color and her favorite place to sleep. If she did not sleep on the lap of one of her family this was her favorite place to sleep. She also knew that they loved her because they made sure to feed her every day. In fact, they fed many times a day.  This is why she was so large.   One day when she was in the yard a group of street cats came up to her. "Oink, oink" they said in mean voices. They were teasing her because she was so big. She did not know that other cats thought that being big was a bad thing. She knew they were upset because they did not have a family to feed them. Maggie went in and meowed to the family to come feed these new cats. They did, and from then on, every day, they came to Maggie's to eat, and Maggie became the most popular girl in the neighborhood.
