All of Larry's friends have a favorite animal. Jim's favorite animal is the bear. Tracy's favorite animal is the monkey. Ryan's favorite animal is the rabbit. But Larry's favorite animal is the panda. The only problem is that Larry has never seen a panda. In fact, none of Larry's friends have seen one. One time, Larry and his friends went to the zoo. There were many animals at the zoo, and everyone was very excited to them. There were monkeys, bears, and even rabbits. When they went to see the monkeys, Tracy even handed one of the monkeys a banana and the monkey ate it. But there was no panda. Everyone started to think there was no such thing as a panda.  If Larry was going to see a panda, he would have find one himself. He packed up his backpack with sandwiches, a chocolate bar, and some water and he went out into the forest. He knew that a panda's favorite food was leaves, so made sure to pack some leaves in his backpack too. He spent two week in the forest looking everywhere for a panda. Finally, when has about to give up, he saw a family of pandas eating and playing. He gave them all the leaves in his backpack. He sat watching them for the rest of the day. He watched pandas bathe and climb trees. Then he went home and went to sleep.
