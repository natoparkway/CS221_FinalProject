Susie really wanted to get a pet. She really liked animals, and her parents said she was ready. What kind of pet did she want? She wanted a pet that wasn't too loud. She didn't want it to wake her up early! She wanted a pet that wasn't too calm. She wanted it to make her laugh! She wanted a pet that was a pretty color. She wanted to show her pet to all her friends! She asked everyone what kind of pet she could get. "Get a pig," said her teacher, Ms. Hammerstein. "Pigs are pink, and pink is a good color." Susie went to the pet store to get a pig. "Oink!" said the pig. "Oink oink oink!" It was very loud. Susie did not like the pig at all. "Get a cat," said her sister, May. "Cats are funny." Susie went to the pet store to get a cat. "Meow!" said the cat. It wasn't too loud, but it was a boring grey. That wasn't a pretty color at all! "Get a turtle," said her brother, George. "Turtles are a pretty green and they aren't very loud." Susie went to the pet store to get a turtle. It didn't say anything, because turtles don't say much. It didn't do anything either. It was too boring for Susie. "Oh no!" said Susie. She was very sad. "There are no good pets for me!" She was about to give up when she saw a bowl on a table. It had water and a little fish in it. The fish was a pretty orange color. It swam in circles all around its bowl. It didn't say anything. It was perfect! "I want the fish!" Susie said, and she bought a new goldfish. She named him Steve, and they were very happy together.
