Bob walked out the door with a huge grin on his face. It was his first day of middle school. His mom, who is a nurse at the high school, waved at him as he entered the bus. The bus driver said "good to see you Bob". Bob said "you too Mr. Smith".  Bob was so excited to see his friends that he could barely breathe. As he walked down the school bus, Bob's friends Jill, Jim, Jeff and Chris all waved to him. Instead of sitting next to his best friend Chris, Bob turned left and sat next to Jill. Jeff and Jim started laughing at him and teased "Bob and Jill sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G". Bob's face turned red from embarrassment.  Chris felt bad for Bob and reached into his pockets to help his friend. When he reached in, he felt a pencil, a rock and a folded up piece of paper. Chris's eyes twinkled. He had a plan. Without Jim and Jeff seeing, Chris quickly made a paper airplane with the piece of paper he found in his pocket. He threw the paper airplane at Jim. The plane hit Jim in the face. Both Jim and Jeff stopped laughing. Bob looked over to Chris and smiled.
