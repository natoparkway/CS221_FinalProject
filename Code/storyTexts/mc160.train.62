On Saturday, Amy and Joe baked a whole chicken for their family's dinner.  They rinsed it in cold water, rubbed it with spices, and put it into a pan.  After they had heated up the oven, they put the chicken and the pan on the center oven rack and set the timer.  Then, as they peeled potatoes and carrots to go with the chicken, Amy, Joe and Cindy talked about dinner.  Amy said, "Joe, this is too much food for you, me and little Cindy to eat in one night. We'll have leftovers.  What can we do with the leftover chicken?"  Joe said, "We could make chicken sandwiches or chicken and rice."  Amy said, "How about chicken soup?"  Cindy said, "I like chicken with Thai noodles with red peppers.  We haven't made those in a long time."   "That sounds good," said Amy.  "We'll make that for dinner tomorrow."  "Yum!" said Joe.  "That's a great idea.  I love Thai noodles."  Later, Joe, Amy and Cindy had finished eating dinner, and Cindy asked Amy for help with her homework.  "I don't understand how to do these math problems!"  Joe said, "You two go ahead.  I'll do the dishes and put away the leftovers."  Soon, Cindy went into the kitchen to get a glass of water.  Joe was eating the chicken. It was almost gone!  "Dad!" said Cindy, "You have eaten almost all of the leftover chicken. We can't have Thai noodles with chicken tomorrow."  Joe looked very sad.  He said "I'm sorry.  I have been a bad dad.  I have to buy more chicken so that we can still have noodles.  Would you like a piece of chicken?"
