David bought a new house and wanted to start a garden in his backyard. He asked his friend Anthony to go with him to the store. David and Anthony went to the store on Saturday to pick out soil and seeds. They went into the big store and passed by many other things like jewelry, books, and movies, and then they reached the garden section. The store's garden section was huge! They had vegetable seeds, plant seeds, and flower seeds. David wanted to grow cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, corn, and potatoes. Anthony helped him find those vegetable seeds. The next day, David started to plant the seeds. In a few weeks, there were lots of vegetables growing in his garden! He began to pick the vegetables and use them when he cooked. He also gave them away as gifts to his family and friends. They loved his vegetables! Soon, David wanted to make his garden even bigger. He went back to the garden store and bought seeds to plant more vegetables. Soon his whole backyard was full of delicious vegetables!
