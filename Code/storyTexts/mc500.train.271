Andrew wanted to make some extra money to buy a toy truck that he really wanted but didn't get for his birthday.  The truck cost thirty dollars and it made four different noises.  The truck also had a ladder that was three feet long.  Andrew had asked for it for his birthday but didn't get it.  He did get a camera from his uncle and a puzzle from his friend.  In order to make the money his mom told him that he needed to do chores around the house.  His mom told him that he could make five dollars by mowing the lawn.  He chose to do this chore and it took him three hours.  She then gave him the money.  He also chose to walk the dog every day for a week which made him one dollar a day.  His grandpa gave him a late birthday present for his birthday.  His grandpa's gift was twelve dollars.  He spent the afternoon counting his money and found that he was still short of his goal.
