It was Saturday afternoon and Andrew was bored. He had been watching TV all day. He told his dad, "There's nothing to do!"  Andrew's dad said, "I think the newspaper is here. Maybe we can find an idea in the newspaper." Andrew looked outside the window and saw the newspaper by the door. On the front was a picture of an elephant.  He picked up the newspaper and brought it to his dad.  Andrew and his dad read the story.  The circus was in town!  Andrew had never been to the circus. He asked his dad, "Can we go?" "Yes, we can,' Andrew's dad said, 'but first you need to feed your goldfish."  Andrew fed his goldfish some goldfish food. He promised to bring it some peanuts from the circus for later.  Andrew and his dad went to the circus.  The people and animals at the circus did lots of tricks. The elephant even went down a slide!  Andrew and his dad ate lots of peanuts.  There weren't any peanuts left to bring home to the goldfish.  Andrew and his dad had a lot of fun at the circus.
