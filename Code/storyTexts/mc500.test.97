Tarwala was a strange boy. He liked to eat anything that was put in front of him, even if it wasn't food. As a child he ate chalk sticks thinking it was candy. All the strange things he ate made him very sick. After eating the chalk, his stomach made a weird noise as if it was trying to talk to him. Tarwala accidentally pooped on the door mat because he did not make it to the bathroom in time, but he still did not stop eating strange things.   One day, Tarwala got in trouble at the zoo for trying to eat lettuce along with the big cats. His parents felt that they needed to help Tarwala fix his problem. His dad had a great idea, and he needed one month to do it. One month later, his dad took off his sock and put it in front of Tarwala. Tarwala immediately ate the sock like he always did, but something special happened. Tarwala saw bright lights and passed out. It turns out that Tarwala's dad did not change his sock or wash his toes for the whole month. The stink was so powerful that it got magical. The magical stink changed Tarwala's mouth, brain, and stomach to help him tell the difference between real food and things that were not food. Tarwala started to eat like a normal child and he lived a good life.
