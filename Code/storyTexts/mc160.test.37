Jimmy didn't eat breakfast. Because he didn't eat breakfast he was very hungry and could not stop thinking about food. He was thinking about all of the things that he liked to eat the most. He was thinking about breakfast foods like bacon and eggs but he was also thinking about lunch and dinner foods like pizza and macaroni and cheese. Jimmy was even thinking about some of his favorite desserts like chocolate cake and cherry pie. He was even thinking about vanilla pudding and he doesn't even like vanilla pudding. Jimmy was so hungry that he was having a hard time playing with his friends. Jimmy was playing with Tommy, Timmy and Suzy. Timmy chose not to play. Jimmy wasn't having any fun because he was so hungry. Jimmy was playing hide and go seek with Tommy and Suzy but he could not find any good places to hide. Jimmy did not want to play hide and seek. If he had to play a game he wanted to play tag but what he really wanted to do was eat lunch.
