Once there was a dog named Noodle. Noodle had two brothers named Puff and Fluff, and a sister named Polly. Noodle's best friend was a boy named Jack. Jack went to school, but the dogs stayed home all day. Jack liked to feed Noodle chicken and beef. One day Jack went to the store and bought chicken for Noodle. Jack put too much chicken in Noodle's bowl. Noodle ate up all the chicken, but then his belly hurt. Poor Noodle! Jack was sad that he had made Noodle feel sick. Jack took Noodle, Puff, and Fluff to the park to run and play. Polly stayed home because she was sick. There were so many things to see at the park. Puff found a little red ladybug. Fluff found a big gray mouse. Noodle found a long brown stick. Jack found a deep pond with three ducks in it. Everyone had a great day at the park. Then the three dogs and Jack all went back home. When they got home, Polly was asleep on the bed. Polly said she was feeling better. Jack brought Polly some chicken noodle soup to eat. Noodle, Puff, and Fluff sat on the bed with Polly eating bones and drinking milk.
