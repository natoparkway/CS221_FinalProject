There was once a frog who lived all the way in the North Pole. His name was Isaac. He worked at Santa's factory, baking cakes with lots of frosting. He didn't like making cake much. In fact, Isaac's dream was to work in the factory with the elves making toys. But since he was a frog, he was never allowed to build toys with the elves. One day, he got a smart idea. He would dress up as an elf and sneak into the factory, hoping no one would find out. So he got a hold of an elf costume and put it on. He put on the elf hat, the elf shirt, and the elf shoes. He really looked like an elf! So one day, when the factory was opening for the morning, Isaac snuck in line with the rest of the elves and tried to get into the factory. Luckily, it worked, and no one found out! Isaac was filled with joy as he had never seen the inside of the toy factory before. It was huge, and there were thousands of elves building toys for the children for next Christmas. He joined them in building, and for a long time, no one knew he was a frog. That is, until one elf, named Joe, saw that there was something weird about Isaac. He didn't look like the rest of the elves. So he kept his eye on Isaac, waiting to see what his secret was. One day, Isaac slipped, and his hat fell off. When this happened, Joe saw that he was a frog, and not an elf! He told Isaac that he would tell Santa all about how he had snuck in. Isaac begged Joe not to tell. Joe wanted to know what was in it for him, so Isaac promised to bake him a cake with lots of frosting. Joe never told.
