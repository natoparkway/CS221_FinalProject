Tom had a pet. Tom loved his pet and would always laugh at the funny thing he did when facing his chin. The pet was a dog. Tom would blow in the dog's ear in order to make him mad. One day Tom wanted to give the dog a treat but he wouldn't eat it. Tom got very upset and confused and said, "I think my dog is going to die." So Tom threw his dog a party in the sand to make his dog happy and have a great life. At the party they only listened to hit songs. Tom let his dog eat anything he wanted, even a dingdong. Tom invited the dog's favorite friend, his nana. He took his dog and the dog's nana and went for a drive on the road. At the end of the party Tom let his dog chew his favorite pencil. The dog was not dying, but he was happy he got to have the best party ever.
