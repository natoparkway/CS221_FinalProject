Nick was so happy to finally meet his cousin. Just this morning he found out what a cousin is. A cousin is somebody who has the same grandmother and grandfather as you. He didn't even know he had a cousin and now they were going to play together. This was going to be a great day.  Right after he ate lunch and had a quick piece of candy for snack he pulled out the letter that his cousin Chris wrote to him. He read it over and over again. They liked so many of the same things, like riding bikes and playing games. It was only twelve o'clock and Nick did not know if he would make it until Chris got here. He had two more hours to go. Nick fell asleep as he was reading a book and woke up to the sound of a car outside. It must be them! He jumped up and ran downstairs and right out the door to the car. That's when he saw Chris through the car window. Nick was really surprised. Chris had a ponytail! Chris was a girl!  It turned out that Nick still really liked his cousin Chris, even if she was a girl.
