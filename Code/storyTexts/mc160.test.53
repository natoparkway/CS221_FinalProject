Jamal made his mommy a special card for her birthday.  When he gave it to her, she smiled and said that it was beautiful.  His dad also gave her a card, but she did not smile the same way.  Mommy didn't look mad, but Jamal knew that she was disappointed.    The next day, Jamal's dad drove him to school.  Jamal said "Daddy, did Mommy not like your birthday card?"    Jamal's dad said, "Well, son, sometimes I don't know what your mother likes.  I could have asked her or thought of something better."    Before Jamal got out of the car, he asked his dad, "Can we go to get ice cream after you pick me up from school?"    "Sure, that sounds good to me," said Jamal's dad.  After school, Jamal and his dad went to the ice cream shop. Jamal said, "Now we can get Mommy the present!"    Jamal's dad said, "What present?  Did you have a secret plan?"    Jamal giggled and ran to the plant store nearby.  Jamal remembered that when Mommy took him to his grandma's house, she told Grandma that she always wanted to have a lily plant.  They found a lily plant in the store.  The woman who worked at the store asked, "Do you want to put this in a pot?"    Jamal's dad told Jamal, "Let's get the yellow pot, because that's Mommy's favorite color."    When they got home, Jamal's mommy came out of the kitchen.  She saw the lily in the bright yellow pot on the table.  Jamal saw her smile, only this time it was the same smile he saw when he gave her the card.  Jamal smiled too because he knew that Daddy made her very happy.
