Lucy was walking with her family in the woods, far away from the city.  Her father helped her see all kinds of animals.  It was like going to the zoo.  They saw deer, a moose, a fox, and a bear.  The bear ran away when her brother shouted.  Lucy thought that was lucky, because she was a little scared of it.  Her father showed her a whistle to blow in case she got lost.  Her brother kept stealing it.  While they were walking down by a stream, Lucy's Mom was making sandwiches for everyone.  Lucy's brother Jim kept blowing the whistle.  He told her that he was going to steal her sandwich if he got there first.  That made her mad!  She really wanted her turkey sandwich and not a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  When their mom called, they both ran back as fast as they could.  Since Jim was older, he was faster and beat her to the picnic.  Lucy started crying.  She thought Jim stole everything!
