Annie's sister, Julia, was having a birthday party in the afternoon.  Annie's mother was going to bake the cake for the party.  Mother asked Annie to help her bake the cake.  They chose to make a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting.  Annie got the bowls and the ingredients they would need for the cake.  She helped measure the flour, the sugar and the cocoa.  Once her mother added the rest of the ingredients, Annie was allowed to stir the ingredients in the bowl.  She helped to pour the cake mix into two pans and then put them in the oven.  The smell of the cake made Annie hungry.  While the cake was baking, Annie helped her mother make the chocolate frosting.  Her mother let her lick the spoon when they were done mixing the frosting.  Once the cake was done, Annie and her mother took the cake out of the oven and let it cool, and then they frosted it.  They ate the chocolate cake at Julia's party with scoops of vanilla ice cream and fresh strawberries.  Annie gave their dog, Sunny, a little piece of cake too!
