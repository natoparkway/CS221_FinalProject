The witch wanted to stop making poisons in her big pot.  She wanted to be a cook instead. She could make all sorts of treats, like blueberry sandwiches, orange pizzas, and grape pie.  Her best treat she made was strawberry eggs. She wanted the people from town to invite her to parties.  She wanted them to ask her to cook for them.  Most of all, she wanted them to be friends with her.  Her plan was to get them to try her strawberry eggs.  They were shaped like eggs but when you would chew on them they tasted like strawberries. They also had medicine in them so they would help people too. They were delicious.  Finally the big day came.  The witch brought her cart into the town.  She was late to town because she got lost.  Then her wagon broke and she had to fix its wheel.    It was full of the strawberry eggs.  The witch started handed them out.  At first people were nervous.  They did not know the witch well.  They knew she was the witch who lived in the woods, all alone. They knew she had made poisons. But once the sheriff tried them, everyone started trying them.   After everyone in town had one, they put the witch on their shoulders and cheered for her, even the town's baker.  Finally the town's leader asked the witch if she would move into the town.  The witch happily said yes and they all had as many strawberry eggs as they could ever want.
