It was the Fourth of July and Frank the cowboy had a meal planned. He was going to cook for the whole town and do it in a bear costume, which was what they did in his part of the nation to celebrate the holiday and was not weird at all.   Unfortunately Frank had mistaken powdered soap for sugar because the eye holes in his bear costume didn't quite match up with his own eyes. He put the whole box of soap in the strawberry punch that he meant to give to his party guests.  "Try the punch," Frank said.  Since they didn't want to be mean, after all Frank went through a lot of trouble in order to respect the town's bear costume wearing ways, the whole town drank the gross drink. No one got sick, but they were all pretty grossed out and after talking to each other planned to help Frank make the meal next year to keep it from happening again.
