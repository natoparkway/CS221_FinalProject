Joe lives in a big city with his mother and father. His father is called Tony, and his mother's name is Clarissa. He likes to go to all the stores and look at the things inside. Sometimes if Joe sees something he likes, his parents buy it for him. Last week, they were in a store and Joe saw a ball that he wanted. Joe's father bought it for him, and Joe was very happy.  Joe's grandmother doesn't live in the city. She lives on a farm. Her name is Hazel. Sometimes Joe's parents take him to visit his grandmother. There are not many stores around where she lives. But Joe is always excited to see her, because there are many things there that are not found in cities. The first time he saw a cow, Joe was scared, because he had never seen a cow in the city. There are always a lot of animals near Joe's grandmother's house. Sometimes there are chickens and pigs and ducks.   Joe's favorite animal is Max. Max is Hazel's dog. He is a friendly dog. He doesn't bark at the other animals. Sometimes Joe and Max play with a ball. Max likes to play with Joe. Sometimes Max doesn't like strangers, but Max has seen Joe a few times, so now they are friends.  Hazel is a very good cook. She always makes Joe's favorite breakfast: eggs, pancakes, and bacon. Sometimes Joe's mother makes the same meals for him, but Hazel's food is always better. Joe is sometimes sad when he leaves Hazel's house. But he knows that he is going to return, so he is not sad for long.
