Kim's birthday was the next day. Every year on her birthday, her mother would make her favorite meal, and they would give Kim her birthday presents. Kim wanted spaghetti for dinner, and a special dollhouse as her present. On the morning of her birthday, Kim's brother Jamie woke her up by pretending to be a monster and making her scream. She was tired for the rest of the day because she could not go back to sleep. Her father thought it was funny and didn't yell at Jamie for teasing his sister. Kim's other brother, Danny, came back home for her birthday, and was helping Jamie tease her. They hid behind the soda and made funny noises. They hid her shoes. They switched where her toys were and made her think she had lost them. By the time dinner was ready, Kim was upset. Then it appeared that her mother had not made the meal she had hoped to have after all. Just as Kim was about to start crying and leave the table, her brothers surprised her with a huge box. Excited, Kim tore open the box to see that it was the dollhouse she wanted. Her mother showed her she had made spaghetti like Kim wanted. Jamie said he was sorry for scaring her, and she, Jamie, and Danny hugged.
