Bob and Sue were in class.  Bob was listening to the teacher.  Sue was looking out the window, thinking about what she would do during recess.  The teacher was writing on the chalkboard as she spoke.  She was very happy to be teaching the children more vocabulary words to use.  Then they could read more books.  The teacher thought reading was always a very fun activity. While thinking, Sue planned how she would climb the tall tree in the playground.  It had many low, thick branches.  She wanted to see what the yard looked like from up above.  She did not think reading was a very fun activity at all.  She would rather be outside. Bob took lots of notes on what the teacher was saying.  He also copied down everything she wrote.  He was very proud of his notes.  If the other students ever needed help, he was glad give it to them. He thought reading the books people his age told him to read boring.  However, he loved borrowing books from his older sister.  Those books were exciting to him.  He wanted to learn more vocabulary so he could better understand the stories in his older sister's books. Soon enough, the bell rang.  Sue practically ran out the door on her way to the tree.  Bob stayed behind to thank the teacher before he left.  The teacher was very happy to have helped her students.
