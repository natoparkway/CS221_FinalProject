James was a nice old man who lived by himself. Every day he would walk down the road by his house and say hello to everyone. It was fun saying hello to everyone but he felt lonely sometimes. He wanted a pet to take care of. One day as he was walking down the road a little brown and spotted puppy came up to him and wanted James to pet him. James reached down and petted the puppy and smiled. James hoped to see the puppy again. Many days later James went for a walk again. He thought to himself, "I guess I won't ever see the brown puppy again. I hoped to see him again." A nice young lady said to James, "Would you like a puppy?" James said, "I would like a puppy that was like the one I petted before." The lady smiled. She was holding the little brown and spotted puppy. She told James that she found the little puppy in the woods. She said that the little puppy did not have a family. James said happily, "I would love to give the puppy a home!" So James grabbed the little brown and spotted puppy and took him home. James and the little brown puppy became great friends. James named him Spotty.
