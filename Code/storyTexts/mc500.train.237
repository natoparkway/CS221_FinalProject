"How are you asleep? It's six in the morning!"  "Hello Dad," I said.  My dad thought waking me up early for father-son time was a treat.  I wished we could hang out at night instead. He sat in the chair at the foot of my bed with an enormously cheesy grin on his face, with a big shopping bag on his lap.  "What's in the bag, Dad?"  "I bought you some presents! You're a growing young man, and it is only right that you pick a sport." Dad dug through the bag, and pulled out a football and a baseball. "Any of these look good?"  "Dad, you know all I want in life is to join the circus! Why can't you let me be myself?"  Dad leaned in closer to me, a serious look on his face. "Son, when I was eight I wanted to join the circus too. But when I got to high school, everybody made fun of me. They told me I was dumb for not playing sports and dumb for practicing juggling all day. They told me that nobody would marry me if I didn't give up my circus dreams."  "Then how did you find Mom?"  "By giving up my dreams of circus juggling and playing football instead! Come on, you'll like it."  I slowly pulled myself out of bed and grabbed the football from Dad's hand. I wanted to make him happy. But I wish he could've been happy with a dream where you didn't get hit with things.
