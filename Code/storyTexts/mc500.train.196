On Tuesday evening, Rick wanted to play with his friends at a playground near his house. Rick's mother, Trish, drove him to the playground. Rick met up with Andrew and Chris. Rick ran to the monkey bars. Andrew ran to the slide. Chris ran to the swings. Trish sat on a bench near the monkey bars and read a book. She wanted to finish the book for a long time and wanted to try to finish right now. Around 6 PM, it started to rain. Trish quickly put her book inside of her jacket to keep it dry. Afterwards, she called Rick and his friends over and told them it was time to go. Rick and Andrew ran to Trish to follow her to the car. Chris tried to run to Trish but tripped and fell. He scabbed his knee. He was in a lot of pain. Trish told Rick and Andrew to get inside of the car. She ran to Chris to check on him. Trish had a bandage in her pocket and put it over Chris' scab. She then helped Chris get to the car. The next day, Rick asked Chris if he was okay from the fall at the playground. Chris said he was okay and wanted to go play at the playground again soon.
