Oil is plentiful in West Texas. When people think of West Texas they think of these machines called "pump-jacks." A pump-jack is a machine that pulls Oil out of the Earth. Robert's job is to fix pump-jacks. So he travels to West Texas to see if he can help. Steve owns many pump-jacks and is having a very tough time keeping them working. During the summer in West Texas the temperature can be over 100, which causes these machines to break often. Robert runs into Steve at a restaurant on a very hot day. After they talked about the weather for a few seconds, Steve says "my machines keep breaking because of this heat!" Robert says "Steve, I think you and I are both in luck because I fix pump-jacks." Immediately, they both travel out to Steve's land and Robert gets to work!
