Emily and her mother enjoy doing things together often.  Many days they like to go to the park or to the swimming pool but today they chose to go to the grocery store.  They went into the store and straight to look at the fruit. Emily looked at the lemons, the bananas, the apples and the pears.  In the end, Emily chose the apples and put them in a bag.  She handed the bag to her mother to put into their shopping cart.  The pair went to the dairy section next and looked at the kinds of yogurt they store had.  There was blueberry, peach, strawberry and vanilla. Emily asked her mother what kind of yogurt they would be getting and her mother said they wanted the blueberry yogurt.  When they got to the checkout, Emily helped her mother when they needed to pay.  Emily gave the cashier two dimes and four pennies.   They gathered up their bags, packed them into their car and drove home.
