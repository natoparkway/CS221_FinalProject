One day the Smith family went to the zoo.  Ann Smith rode her bike from place to place.  Joe Smith crawled everywhere he went.  Their parents, Katie and Mike Smith, walked.  After visiting many animals they all met up at the monkey cage.  There was a long line to feed the monkeys.  The line was so long that Joe fell asleep for a bit.  Finally, it was time for the Smith family to feed the monkeys. The daughter, Ann, feed the monkeys a banana.  The son, Joe, fed the monkeys a cracker.  The mother, Katie, fed the monkeys a piece of cheese.  The father, Mike, fed the monkeys an apple.  After the monkeys were done eating the zoo worker told them to pick their favorite treat, and give the person who gave it to them a hug.  The monkeys all hugged Joe.  Joe's parents were proud of him for picking the treat he liked best.  As a reward, they gave him a special prize.  Joe got the bike he had always wished for.  At the end of the day he left the zoo a very happy child.
