Max was a little dog that loved to ride the train. Every day when the sun came up Max would run down to the stop and wait until the train stopped and jump on. He thought this was the best time of his life. He always wore a blue collar and a red piece of fabric. Except for on the weekends he would wear a green collar. Sometimes when Max would run next to the train, he would get a splash of mud on his fur. His friend, Bob, didn't like it when Max came home dirty. If Max came home with mud on his fur, Bob would make him sleep outside for the night, but if Max came home clean he would sleep in the house. Max didn't mind sleeping outside, because he could hear the train's whistle and he would dream all night about the train. The funny thing about Max was that he didn't like going for a drive with Bob in a car, on a bike or in a boat. The only way you get Max to go somewhere was on a train. Max must have been a train driver in a past life.
