Robert was excited that Halloween was coming.  He and his mother went to the store to look at costumes so that he could pick one.  There was a a witch costume, a horse costume and a costume that looked like a doggy.  Robert thought he would get the dog costume because he thought he could make a great woof sound.  His mother bought it for him and he couldn't wait to wear it.  On Halloween night, Robert was all dressed to go out trick or treating and waited for his Dad to take him out.  His father told him that he had talked to the lady who lived next door and she was hoping that her granddaughter could go trick or treating with them.  Robert thought it would be okay if she came along and they went to go pick her up.  Robert found out her name was Tessa.  He was happy to see that she was wearing a costume that looked like a kitten.  Their costumes would go well together.  They went from house to house getting candy.  Some people gave them jelly beans, some gave them chocolate bars and some gave them cookies.  Robert's favorite treat that they got was the chocolate bars.  When they got home they saw they had both gotten a lot of candy.  It was a great Halloween and Robert was very happy.
