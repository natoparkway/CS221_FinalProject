Once upon a time there was a fish that lived in a bowl.  The fish wanted to give a kid a party.  But the fish was sad. The fish had no present to give to the kid.  The fish would give the kid a spoon. But the fish had no spoon.  The fish was a cutie.  The fish had an idea.  The fish had a stone in the bowl.  The fish could give the kid the stone!  The fish took the stone from the bowl.  The fish put the stone in a bag.  The fish gave the kid a party and gave the kid the stone as a gift.  The kid told his granddaddy and his mommy that the fish was a cutie.  The kid gave the fish a banana.  The fish ate the banana and was very happy.  The fish and the kid are friends and they love each other.
