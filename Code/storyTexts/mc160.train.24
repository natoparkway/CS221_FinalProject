Chocolate was a box turtle.  Lauren found her one day on the side of the road, hiding in her old, worn shell, frightened by the cars going by.  Lauren picked Chocolate up to help her cross the street, because Lauren knew that turtles are very slow and cars are very fast.  After Lauren got Chocolate to the other side of the road, Chocolate peeked her head out of her shell and looked at the little girl.  Lauren saw that not only was Chocolate's shell worn, one of her eyes was shut.  Lauren thought Chocolate needed more help from her, so Lauren took the turtle home.  Lauren hid Chocolate in her bathtub, because she was worried that her mother would be mad. Lauren went to look up what turtles like to eat and left Chocolate alone in the bathtub.  Lauren was still looking up  turtle facts when she heard her mother call out, "Lauren, get in here now!"  Lauren knew she was in trouble.  But when Lauren came into the bathroom, her mother was smiling.  Lauren's mom told her that she had a turtle when she was a little girl.  Lauren and her mom took Chocolate to an animal doctor who treated sick turtles.  The doctor gave them special drops to put in Chocolate's eyes.  Lauren put the drops in Chocolate's eyes, like the doctor told her and soon the turtle's eyes were all better. Chocolate's shell was still old and worn looking, like an old shoe, but now her eyes were beautiful, like the golden jewels on Grandma's earrings. Lauren was glad that she helped Chocolate.
