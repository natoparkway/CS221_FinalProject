Tony was at home and making dinner. He wanted spaghetti so he made that and some bread too. He added some spices and sauce too. After making dinner, he fed his kitten. His kitten's name is Marbles. Tony was going to name him Arlo or Jack but chose Marbles. Tony played with Marbles for hours. He also cleaned the room and kitchen. After playing with Marbles, Tony went to sleep. The next day, Tony woke up to a bird calling out his window. He got out of bed and got ready for the day. He made some eggs and toast. After eating, he headed to the park. The park was pretty empty. Tony walked around the park. Tony talked to some people after walking. He watched some kids playing and having a good time. It made him feel good. After a few hours, Tony left the park to go home. He laid in his bed and watched TV. It was nice for Tony to have a break.
