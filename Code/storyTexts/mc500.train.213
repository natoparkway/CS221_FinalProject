Sam's granddad was going to take Sam and his two brothers, James and Evan on vacation.  They could choose to go to the lake or the beach.  If they chose the lake, they would get to go on their granddad's boat.  If they chose the beach, there would be sand to dig in.  All three boys began to clap and cheer for the beach!  The boys left their house in their granddad's van to drive to the beach.  They drove by their school on the way.  The boys were glad to be out for the summer.  On the road, the boys played a game.  Whoever counted the most big trucks would be the winner.  James counted one hundred and five trucks.  This was more than Sam or Evan counted.  Evan pointed out the window at a man dressed all in black riding a black motorcycle.  The man had a long beard.  When they got to the beach, their granddad told them to put on sunscreen so they would not get sun burned. The boys grabbed their pails and shovels and ran down on to the sand near the water.  Their granddad brought a chair to sit on and a large umbrella to give him shade.  He also brought some noodles for the boys to float on if they went into the water.  Sam found a piece of wood washed up on the beach.  He used it make a bridge over large hole that the boys had dug.
