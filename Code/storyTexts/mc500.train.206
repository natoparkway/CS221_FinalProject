Once there was a boy named Fritz who loved to draw. He drew everything. In the morning, he drew a picture of his cereal with milk. His papa said, "Don't draw your cereal. Eat it!" After school, Fritz drew a picture of his bicycle. His uncle said, "Don't draw your bicycle. Ride it!" At nighttime, after he finished washing his face, he drew a picture of the toothpaste on the sink. His mama said, "Don't draw the toothpaste. Brush your teeth!"   One day Fritz got a splinter in his foot. It hurt. He wanted to take the splinter out. But first, he drew a picture of his foot with the splinter in it. He said, "Now I can remember what my foot looks like with a splinter in it." Then he took the splinter out all by himself. He told his friend Stephen that he took the splinter out all by himself. Stephen did not believe him. Fritz showed him the picture. Then Stephen believed him.
