The booger on the balloon sailed far and wide.  The wind pushed it.  The wind pulled it.  The booger on the balloon sailed into a house.  In the house was a table.  On the table was an orange.  Next to the orange was some chocolate.  Under the table was a crayon.  Under the crayon was a seed.  The booger on the balloon flew out of the house.  Outside, there was snow.  A dog went woof.  A cat went meow.  But the booger on the balloon did not hear them.  The booger on the balloon had no ears!  The wind blew the booger on the balloon far away, until one day...  ...POP!  The booger on the balloon fell on top of an alligator, never to be seen again.
