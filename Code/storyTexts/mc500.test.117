Leah Catches a Fish  Leah loved to eat fish as a young girl.  She saw fish as good food. But she asked, "Where do fish come from?"  "People have to catch them," Daddy said." Leah wanted to know how to catch a fish.  "People have caught fish from a pole, line, and hook for a long time," Daddy said."  "I am about to show you how to that."    "Let's take a lunch with us," Daddy said.  Leah chose some fries with ketchup and a bean sandwich. Leah also like sweets.  She brought some candy bears.  Leah has strange tastes.  Daddy drove to a nearby lake.  It was early.  Leah was yawning in daddy's car.  The people at the lake had special times for young people learning to fish.  They talked with Leah about them.  Leah was excited.  Daddy took Leah to a small spot on the lake.  Daddy showed Leah how to put a worm on the hook as something to get the fish. Daddy said other like things like grasshoppers, corn, or tiny fish could also get the fish.  Leah lifted her pole and dropped her line in the water.  The small red and white float was there on the water.  It was easy to see that from the blue water and sunny sky.  Leah said, "Daddy I'm bored."  Daddy told her that sometimes you need to wait.  After a short wait, the float went under!  "Leah, you have a fish!" Daddy yelled.  Leah lifted up her line and took the small fish out of the water.  "Daddy, I can catch fish", she happily said.
