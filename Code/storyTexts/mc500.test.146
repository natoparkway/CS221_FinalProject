One day a man named John was walking down the block near the park when he came across a butterfly. The butterfly was on a flower in the park. The butterfly was named Jill. John watched as Jill flew from the flower to a telephone down the block. He followed Jill and watched her land on the phone. He felt curious about why Jill was sitting on the phone. Because of that feeling, he picked up the phone and all of a sudden he passed out. When he woke up he was in a warmer place than before. He looked around and saw that he was on a small piece of land in the middle of the ocean. Its name was Otonga, but John didn't know that. He looked behind him and saw a forest and a big volcano. Next to him there was a cat named Bob. John felt happy to be in such a nice place. He got up. Bob ran away into the forest. John looked at the ocean, but he couldn't see anything else there. He followed Bob. After walking through the forest for a short time he got tired and sat down.
