It was a rainy day and James wanted to play. If he went outside to play, he would get wet. James' mother told him not to get wet because he might catch a cold. James went out to play, anyway.  Outside, the cool rain kept falling. There were no other children for James to play with. The other children were all playing inside, where it was warm and dry.   James found a puddle that had appeared in the mud. He found a piece of wood and pretended it was a turtle. He put the wooden turtle in the puddle and watched it float in a circle. This was not very fun. After one hour, James went back inside.  When James went inside, he found his mother waiting. She had her hands on her hips and a serious look on her face. James was soaking wet! His mother made him change into dry clothes, and he was not to leave the house for the rest of the day.  The next morning, the sun shone warm and bright, and the birds sang their morning songs. It was a beautiful day. When James woke up, he coughed. Then he sneezed. His body ached all over. James had a cold!  James looked out the window and saw the neighbor children playing in their yards. They were having a lot of fun. James wanted to join them, but he was too sick. His mother was right.
