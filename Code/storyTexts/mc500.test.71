The dog walked around the city. He was looking around. He was trying to find food. He smelled the trashcan to see what might be inside. He did not smell anything that he liked. He kept looking. He could not find anything. Someone came by and some him. The person saw that the dog was very skinny so he felt bad. This man that saw him went into a store. He bought him some things for the dog. Those things included some dog food, water and a blanket. He did not buy him any toys or a bed because he did not have much money. He went over to the dog and put all these things next to him. The dog went over to the items. First he smelled them. Then he started eating the food. After he ate, he drank some water. When he was finished, he licked the man on his face. After that, the dog laid down on the blanket and took a long nap. He had a happy look on his face. The kind man walked away.
