Logan had lots of toys. He had balls, dinosaurs, race cars, and even robots! Logan had so many toys he had a room for his toys. There he could play with whatever he wanted, when he wanted, and not even have to pick them back up. Logan had all kinds of balls. He had red ones, green ones, blue ones and even a pink one he hid from his sister. His robots were so cool they could change shape, fly, or race. Some even saved the world in his imagination. Logan loved his dinosaurs. He had one with big sharp teeth, one with little tiny arms, one with purple spots, and even one that his dad said didn't eat anything but plants and vegetables. Logan's favorite toys were his race cars. That was because when his dad came home from work he always went to the toy room with Logan to play with his race cars. Logan had so much fun he even lets his sister in his toy room so she can play dad too! The toy room was Logan's favorite room in the house. He spends all the time he can in his room with all his friends and family and he has so much fun.
