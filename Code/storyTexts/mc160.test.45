My puppy is a boy puppy. His name is Snow. He is white like snow. Snow has a dog house. It is blue. Snow likes his dog house. He sleeps in it at night.   If Snow is hungry I feed him puppy food. I also give Snow water.   Snow is a good puppy. He does what I tell him to do. Snow likes to play with our cat, His name is Oscar. They share toys. Snow and Oscar watch my goldfish, Felix. Felix swims round and round in his bowl.   My neighbor Tommy lives next door. He has a fish, too. Its name is Rocket. That is because he swims very, very fast. Rocket is black. Tommy likes to climb in trees. He also likes to play tag.   I teach Snow tricks. He loves to learn to do tricks. When he does them well I give him a prize! Snow loves to get a prize. It is a tasty puppy treat!  When I come home from school.  Snow meets me at the door. He is so happy to see me. I am happy to see him, too!  After I finish my homework we play ball outside. Snow loves to run after the red ball. He brings it back to me each time I throw it. I love to play ball with Snow. It is so much fun.   I love Snow and Snow loves me. We are best friends.
