A single parent took their child on a trip. The trip was to the playground. The child had a fear of the playground, because she had dug a hole and it had made her trip once. The parent put the child on the sofa and put her shoes on, telling her that it would be alright, and they would be back home by nine. At the playground, the child met a witch. The witch had a piggy with her. The witch stood in the middle of the street. She had a broom. The child wondered what there was to sweep at the playground. Instead, the witch made a chicken, and gave some of it to the child. The witch was saying that it was a gift for her. She thought a gift would help the child with her fear. The child ate the chicken. Then she asked the witch a question. She asked what the witch had a broom for. The witch laughed. She told the girl it was to fly with. The girl did not believe her. The witch sat on her broom and flew away. In the distance, a dog howled.
