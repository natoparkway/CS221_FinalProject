Sammy loved playing baseball. He would play every day, even if there was no practice that day! One day, Sammy went to the park with his mom to play catch with his friends, but as he was playing, he tripped over a rock, and his shoe slipped off! His shoe went flying into the air, high up into the sky, and Sammy watched as the shoe fell into old man Mr. Grumpy's yard.  What was he going to do? His mom sat on a bench not too far away, reading a book. "Should I tell Mom?" Sammy thought to himself. He thought that maybe he shouldn't, because he might get in trouble. Instead, he was going to climb the fence into Mr. Grumpy's yard! "What, are you crazy?" Sammy's friend Billy said when he told him what he was going to do. Billy didn't seem to like the idea. "Mr. Grumpy is a mean old man, and he'll yell at you for sure. I think you need to tell your mom!" With that, Billy ran off to tell Sammy's mom! Sammy ran after Billy, trying to get him to stop, but Billy told the whole story before Sammy could get there. After Sammy's mom heard the story, she took Sammy by the hand and said, "Come on, Sammy, let's go get your shoe!" Sammy was worried. What was she going to do? Sammy's mom took him straight to mean old Mr. Grumpy's door, and knocked on it. "Oh no!" thought Sammy, "He's going to yell at me!" But the man who opened the door was a nice old man, and he smiled at little Sammy, and let them get his shoe. That's when Sammy learned that it's always better to be honest.
