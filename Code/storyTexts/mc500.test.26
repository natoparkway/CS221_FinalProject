Tomorrow was Little Bunny's birthday.  He was very excited.  He wanted to invite all of his friends.  "We only have enough cake for five friends." His mother said.  Little Bunny thought and thought.  He wanted to invite Rabbit, Bear, Duck and Goose.  Little Bunny could invite one more friend. He thought about Turtle. Turtle was lots of fun and always told funny jokes.  He thought about Fox. Fox was super nice and always made Little Bunny feel good.  He also thought about how not inviting one of his friends would make them feel bad.  Little Bunny didn't want to make anyone feel bad. After a little bit he had an idea.  He told his mother his idea. "I like both Turtle and Fox, and I want them both to come.  One would feel really left out if they didn't get invited.  I can give my cake to one of my friends, and that way they can both come and have a piece." His mother thought it was very sweet of Little Bunny to give up his piece of birthday cake so that none of his friends would feel left out. "I'll tell you what." Said his mother.  "I'll make a batch of cupcakes, and all of your friends can have some."
