A boy woke up super excited for this special day.  He could not contain his excitement knowing that the soccer final was today!  He had been working all year long to get to this day.  He quickly hopped off his bed and went to eat his breakfast.  His mom had made pancakes, waffles, and eggs, but the boy felt like eating cereal.  His mom had laid out his soccer clothes and after he was done with his breakfast, he couldn't wait to put them on.  He quickly changed into the clothes, and ran to the car where his mom was waiting for him to get in.  The ride seemed to take a long time as he was super excited to play.  The team was there and they started a small practice before the big game!  The game started and the boy was very nervous since the other team looked really good.  His team was as good too and they were tied at the end!  Everyone either got a trophy or a medal for playing in the game, and the boy got a trophy.  It was one of the best times the boy had ever had.  The day was starting to get dark and he could feel sprinkles on his hands. His parents asked the boy if he wanted to eat ice cream and pizza after the game.  The boy said he was tired and went home with his parents and he could not stop talking about how super fun the game was.  He talked and talked and talked and his parents were very proud of him.  He talked so much that he fell asleep in the car!  His dad carried him into the house and put him in his bed.  The boy had such a great day that he dreamed of soccer all night long. The trophy he had been given would let him remember about the fun day he had.
