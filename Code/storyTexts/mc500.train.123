My name is Clyde. I am am a cat. I have had a life full of adventure. I started out as a small kitten living in a house. I lived with my human family. I also lived with my mother and brothers and sisters. There were some other animals there too. They were not cats but they were not humans. I am not sure what they were but they were big and friendly.   I left his house and moved into different house. I had to leave my family. There were new humans now. They took me in this thing they called a car. It scared me! Everything was moving so fast. There was another one of those different animals. I think the humans called it a dog. His name was Rex. The humans were very nice to me but the dog was not. He would chase me around the house. I would have to hide under the couch or in some other small space. I heard the humans talk about taking me some place else to live.       Next thing I know I am in the car again. I am living in another house. Uh oh! This house has a dog and other humans. This dog, who they call Sophie, was very nice to me. She smelled me and licked me like my mother used to do! We became close friends. I liked this new house. The humans were nice to me too. They had two small humans. Their names were Thomas and Nicole. I liked them because they like to play with me a lot.   One day a big truck came to the house and the humans put me in a room and closed the door. I was in there for a long time. When I came out all the human stuff was not there. They had put it all into the truck. I was scared again that I would have to go with new humans. This time, the humans took me with them! We moved to a new apartment in the city. I knew that these were not my humans. They loved me. They were my new family.
