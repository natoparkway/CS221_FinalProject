The dinosaur wants to have a pet goldfish. He is reading a book called, "How to Take Care of Your Pet Goldfish" because he wants to learn how to take care of a goldfish.  After he finishes reading the book, he goes to the pet store. The pet store is not in Detroit, St. Louis, or Pakistan. The pet store is in a town called Oceanside. It takes the dinosaur an hour to walk to the store. The store is very big, so that the dinosaur can fit inside.  A worker from the store walks up to the dinosaur and asks, "How can I help you?"  "I'm looking to buy a pet goldfish," the dinosaur said.  "Are you sure?" the worker asked, "We have rainbow fish, red fish, and blue fish. The rainbow fish makes for a great pet."  "No, thank you," the dinosaur said, "Goldfish are my favorite."  And so the worker put a goldfish in a bag of water for the dinosaur.  "Why did you put the goldfish in a bag of water?" the dinosaur asked.  "Fish always love to have something to swim in," the worker answered, "Enjoy your goldfish!"  And so the dinosaur walked home, his new best buddy in hand.
