Chad walked to the pet store. He saw puppies. There was a black and white puppy. Chad liked the puppy. Chad walked the puppy home on a leash. He took the puppy in the yard to play. He found a ball to play fetch with the puppy. Chad threw the ball and the puppy chased it across the yard. After they were done playing, Chad fed and watered the puppy. He found two bowls in the kitchen. He filled one with water. He filled the other bowl with dog food. The puppy ran to the bowls to eat and drink. When the puppy was finished eating it became tired. Chad made the puppy a bed out of an old pillow. The puppy curled up on the pillow and went to sleep.
