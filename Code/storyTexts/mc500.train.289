Max was sitting at home reading his favorite book.  The story was about cakes.  Max thought to himself, "I am going to go to the store and get stuff to make a cake!"   Max headed to the grocery store to get the cake ingredients.  Max was going to make a banana and chocolate cake.  On his way he saw his friend Greg, a small wolf.  Greg was also heading to the store.  Greg was going to make a pie for his mother.  He needed to get strawberries and blueberries.  Max asked Greg if he wanted to walk to the store together.  Greg the wolf said yes, so they walked to the store together.  At the store the other people looked at Max and Greg.  They had never seen an alligator and a wolf who are friends before.  Max and Greg laughed at this.  Max got the chocolate and bananas to make his cake and Greg got the strawberries and blueberries to make his pie.  They left the store.  Max waved good bye to Greg.  "See you later alligator," said Greg.  Max went home and made his cake, it was very good.
