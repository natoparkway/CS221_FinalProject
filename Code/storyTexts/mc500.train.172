Thomas looked up at the clock hanging on the wall of his room. He could not wait for his friend Ben to come over today. It was the weekend, so Thomas's dad had no work the next day. This meant his father would take them sledding. This was one of Thomas' favorite winter activities, even if he always got a few bumps and scrapes along the way. Thomas heard a knocking noise downstairs and knew it was Ben at the door. He got excited. This meant they would be sledding soon. He grabbed another mouthful of one of his mother's famous sugar cookies and made his way downstairs, tripping on his shoes. He opened the door to see Ben's mom giving him a friendly smile down the walk. Ben let himself in and his mother waved goodbye to them both. Thomas asked Ben if he wanted a cup of hot chocolate and then he went to find his dad for some sledding action.  Both Ben and Thomas were very happy. They got their gloves on and made their way out to the garage to wait for Thomas' dad. Thomas dad would be driving them the long distance to the park.
