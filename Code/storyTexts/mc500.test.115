Justin sat down for dinner with his Mother, who was 40, and Father, who was 45 and Sister as he always did when it was time to eat. He always sat across from his sister, Melissa. Tonight's dinner was meatloaf, mashed potatoes with butter, and green peas. Justin's mother made the best meatloaf. She said that her mother used the same recipe. Similar recipes were made by her friend, her aunt, and sister. But the one Justin's mom used was the best. Melissa was 7 years old, and Justin was 10. Melissa waited until she didn't think Mom and dad were looking and stuck her tongue out at Justin. What Melissa didn't know was that her mom had seen her and told her that it wasn't polite. "But mom! I was only playing!" Melissa said. "No 'buts', young lady!" Mom said. Justin shook his head as he took a bite of mashed potatoes.
