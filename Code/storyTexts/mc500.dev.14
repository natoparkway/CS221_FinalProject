Tammy was a purple tiger.  She was friends with Bobby the blue bird.  They were hungry so they went to the store together.  At the store they saw some friends.  They saw Pat the pink panther. They also saw Roger the red rabbit.  Pat bought potatoes and eggs.  Roger bought carrots and celery.  Tammy bought some salad.  Tammy also bought a pizza.  Bobby bought seeds.  They all wanted to eat dinner.  They went back to Tammy's house to have supper.  Tammy ate salad and seeds.  Roger ate carrots and celery.  Bobby ate potatoes.  Pat ate eggs and carrots.  Tammy was still hungry, so she ate some pizza too.  They were all very full.  They took a nap.  After they woke up they played some games.  Everyone had fun at Tammy's house.  It got late and everyone went home.  Tammy was pleased with how it turned out.
