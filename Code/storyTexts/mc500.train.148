Fanny the fly was hungry.  She went to the store.  She saw her friend Colin the cat at the store.  Colin waved to Fanny.  Fanny waved back.  At the store, Fanny bought ice cream, fruit, and pasta.  Then she went home.  She looked in her fridge.  In her fridge she saw meatballs, rice, tomato sauce, and garlic.  She chose to make a pasta dinner and invite all of her friends over.  She invited Colin the cat and Danny the dog.  She also invited Freddy the frog and Allen the alligator.  Everyone arrived to a beautiful meal made by Fanny.  They all ate happily.  After dinner, Fanny brought out dessert.  She brought out pie, fruit, cupcakes, and ice cream.  Everybody ate a cupcake.  Danny ate ice cream too.  Allen had some pie and fruit as well as the cupcake.  Colin had some pie too.  Fanny told everyone to come back for dinner again.  They all said goodbye and left.  Fanny was happy and full.  She went to bed smiling to herself.
