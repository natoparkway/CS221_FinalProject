Todd lived in a town outside the city . Unlike the city the town was peaceful and quiet and full of trees, flowers and animals.  One day his dad came in from work and said "Come on, son, I'm going to take you to the city." Todd was very exited so he put on his shoes and ran to the car.  When they got to the city Todd was very surprised there were so many cars and people, everyone seemed to be in a hurry. There were no trees, no flowers, and no animals. Todd was so happy to get back home.  When his mom asked him about his trip to the city Todd said,"There's no place like home."
