Paul worked as a cook in a restaurant. For Valentine's Day, he made chocolate desserts. He tripled the recipe to feed all the people. He separated the eggs and measured the sugar. Then he melted the chocolate. He mixed the egg whites until they made a thick foam. He mixed the egg yolks with the sugar. But as he was ready to mix everything, his boss asked him to do a different job. Paul chopped some vegetables.   When he came back, Greg had taken over his work and made a mistake. The mix was much too thin. It looked like chocolate soup. It wouldn't rise at all. Luckily Paul was ready. He had practiced the dessert recipe before. It looked like it didn't have enough egg whites. Paul separated more eggs and mixed the egg whites. He added the extra egg whites to the mix. His addition worked. The desserts rose high in the oven. He saved the day!
