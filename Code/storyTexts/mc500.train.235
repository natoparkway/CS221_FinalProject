Emilia wished her daughter would eat all her broccoli at suppertime, but it was beginning to seem like it was not going to happen. She was disappointed and felt a bit like a bad mother. She wondered how her own mother had gotten her to eat the food when she was a silly little girl like her daughter, Elise. She grabbed the telephone to ask her mother how she had done it. She had to wait a second before the older woman picked up, but she was greeted with a happy voice. She learned from her mother that she had tricked her into believing her broccoli was a forest of trees. Emilia thought this was a good plan. After she hung up the phone she picked up her son's pacifier off the floor. She then washed it off. She did not want there to be any dirt from the floor on the pacifier. When he daughter Elise came down the stairs for dinner she told her daughter a story about how she was a giant and broccoli was a small forest of trees. After that Elise always ate her broccoli.
