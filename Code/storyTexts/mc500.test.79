Lisa wants a new pet. Sometimes it is very hard trying to choose a new pet. There are so many different animals, each cuter than the last. There are cats, dogs, and goldfishes. In the end, Lisa chose a bunny. Lisa's bunny is very cute. The bunny has snowy white fur and large black eyes. His ears are large, floppy, and grey. She named the bunny Chomper since Chomper loves to eat everything. Chomper eats carrots, celery, and even licks Lisa's fingers! Nothing to worry, Chompers has a very small mouth and he is never fussy. Except...every time Lisa leans down to kiss Chomper - he runs away! Why? Chomper thinks Lisa is trying to steal his treats! He hates sharing his treats. Chomper always wants second helpings of food. Lisa is afraid Chomper would get so big he could fall off her lap. But not to worry Lisa, Chomper hops around the house a lot. Chomper knows how to stay fit like Lisa. It's clear as day! Lisa and Chomper make great friends.
