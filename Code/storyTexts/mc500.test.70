Tiger was a pig. Tiger's aunt Tabby always took care of Tiger. All Tiger had to do was make an oink and Tabby would come running to check on Tiger. Sometimes Tiger got into fights with his brother Tom and Tabby always took Tiger's side. One time Tiger accidentally lit a bush on fire when he was playing with a looking glass and the bush burned to the ground. Tabby was very mad and Tiger blamed it on Tom. Tabby believed Tiger, because she thought Tom was a trouble maker. One time Tabby took a trip to the ocean and she took Tiger, but not Tom. Tom was very upset, but acted like he didn't want to go. Tom said he would rather go to the forest, the moon or the mountains, but never would he go to the ocean. This wasn't true, but Tom didn't want to let Tiger and Tabby know that they hurt him. When Tabby and Tom went to the ocean, their uncle Leon came to visit and to take care of Tom. Tom had never met Leon before. Leon loved Tom and made him feel very special. When Tabby and Tom came home Leon left and Tom went to live with him. They went to the ocean together; the mountains, the forest and Leon even took Tom to the moon. Tom was happy, because he got to see things that Tiger never got to see. They lived happily ever after.
