The pink rabbit is sitting on a bench in the park. The pink rabbit loves being at the park because she loves bird watching. She watches birds, and sometimes feeds them. She doesn't feed them corn, candy bars, or pizza. She feeds them sunflower seeds.  Across from the pink rabbit, a blue dinosaur is sitting alone at a seesaw. The blue dinosaur likes playing on the seesaw because he thinks it's fun. The blue dinosaur is sad, because he can't ride on the seesaw by himself.  The pink rabbit sees the blue dinosaur. She sees that he is by himself. She feels sad because she knows he cannot play on the seesaw.  The pink rabbit hops over to the blue dinosaur and asks, "Would you ride the seesaw with me?"  The blue dinosaur said, "Sure."  And they rode on the seesaw for the rest of the afternoon. It was the best afternoon of their lives.
