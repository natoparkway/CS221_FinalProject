Hannah was so sad! If she had one wish, it would be that she was well enough to go outside and play. The storm last night had brought a lot of snow, she could see it through the window. The snow caused everything to twinkle and shine, like it was colored with a marker made of glitter. What a way to start Christmas break, with the flu making her stuck on the sofa under a blanket. Hannah's brother was getting ready to go outside and enjoy the snow. He put on his jacket and put her hat on his head. He had to wiggle his gloves out of his pocket, but he was nice and warm. From the sofa, Hannah watched her brother play in the snow with his friends and throw snowballs. Her brother tossed a stone at the pond and it broke through the ice with a splash.
