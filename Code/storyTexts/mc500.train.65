Hailey stood in her kitchen. She was looking for ideas of what to make for dinner. She could make pasta, soup, chili, or steak. She opened the refrigerator and took out a cartoon of juice. She sat down at the table and tried to write a list of ingredients she would need. She finally thought she would make chili for dinner. She took a sip of her juice and she saw she had all the ingredients she needed except meat.   Hailey saw she was losing daylight. This made her want to take her car to the store in order to buy the meat. It would be faster than walking.  She quickly went to the back of the store where she knew the meat was stored and took her find to the cashier. When she made her way back into the lot she ran into her friend, Beth, and invited Beth to come to her house for dinner.   When they both returned to her home they cooked dinner together and had a wonderful evening.
