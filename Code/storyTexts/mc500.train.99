Marcel lived on a farm. Every morning when he woke up, he got dressed, washed his face, and then helped his Pa with the chores before having breakfast. After breakfast, he walked with his sisters to the school in the town.   One day on his way to school, Marcel remembered he left his books on the table. "Oh no!" he said. "I forgot my books!"  His older sister Lucianne frowned. "Oh, Marcel, how could you be so forgetful? You'll have to go home and get them."  Marcel's younger sister Paula was excited. "I can go get your books for you," she said.  "No," Marcel said. "You're too young to go home by yourself. It'll have to be me."  "Be careful," Lucianne warned him. "And hurry, or you'll be late for school."  Marcel chose to leave the road so he could get home faster. So he left the road and ran into the grassy pasture, passing by a group of lambs. The shepherd waved at him as he ran past.
