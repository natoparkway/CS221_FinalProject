Tom was the best baseball player in his neighborhood. He also enjoyed playing basketball, but he wasn't very good at it. Every morning he would get up and go out to the baseball field, and every night he would dream about his favorite players. He loved the Yankees, and knew he would someday play for them. One day when Tom was practicing at the field, a man in a nice suit came out of a long car and walked over to Tom. The man said that he worked for the Yankees, and was there to see Tom play! Tom was so excited he could scream! Knowing that the man was watching, he played the best game ever that day. When he was done, the man told Tom that he was good enough to play for the Yankees, and to pack his things right away. Tom hurried home as fast as he could, and started to pack up all his clothes. His mom walked in and asked what Tom was doing. "I'm going to play for the Yankees ma!" Tom said. Tom's mom was so excited that she took Tom and the whole family out for dinner. Grandpa, Grandma, Mom and Dad were all there, and bought Tom a big cake! As Tom said goodbye to everyone, he couldn't help but feel sad that he would be gone for so long. "Don't worry son, we'll be at all the games cheering you on!" said his dad. This made Tom happy again, and as he left to be with his team, he knew that he had finally made it.
