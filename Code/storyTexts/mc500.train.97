One morning Julie took her dog, Rosie, for a walk. Rosie loved to walk outside. She loved to walk any time - morning, afternoon, or night. She liked to smell everything. This morning she smelled something new. It was another animal. It was not a squirrel. It was not another dog. Maybe it was a tiger! Rosie sniffed around until she saw the other animal. It was not a tiger. It was a cat. The cat was watching Rosie. The cat was afraid Rosie would try to bite her, so she climbed up a tree. Rosie tried to follow her, but she could not climb up. Instead, she barked at the cat in the tree. Julie did not want Rosie to scare the cat. She called Rosie away from the tree. The cat watched them walk away. When they came back, the cat was gone. Rosie remembered the cat. She started digging in the dirt under the tree. But there was no cat there. Julie and Rosie went home for breakfast.
