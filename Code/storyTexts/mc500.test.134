One day Poppy the puppy went outside to play. He ran around the yard as fast as he could. After running, Poppy began to play with his ball. When Poppy was tired of that, Poppy play catch with Mary. Poppy was very happy when Mary wanted to play with him. Poppy would jump on Mary and start to lick her face. Mary was happy when Poppy showed her all that love. Later on Mary and Poppy went inside to eat and take a nap.
