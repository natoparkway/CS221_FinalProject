John was an old man who lived in New York City.  John used to work at the Post Office before he quit.  John has a grandson named Timmy.  Timmy came to visit John and brought his friends David, Roger, and Bill.  John gave them each a glass of lemonade to drink.   Timmy wanted his friends to try his grandfather's meat soup.  John was known to be a good cook.  He enjoyed cooking burgers, fish, pizza, and soup.  John's meat soup was his favorite recipe.  John asked his grandson to go to the store to buy the food.  He wanted Timmy to buy some meat.  Timmy took some money from John and went to Kroger.   Timmy thought of buying ground beef, chicken, turkey, and sausage.  He bought three pounds of ground beef.  He took it back to John, who had started making the soup in his kitchen.    John cooked the ground beef and added it to the soup.  They let the soup cook for two hours and then John tested it to see if it was ready to eat.  The soup tasted delicious.  Timmy and his friends loved it and told John they would be back for more.
