Elizabeth jumped right out of bed on Saturday morning.  Today was the day her father was going to take her and her sister, Rebecca, to the zoo.  Her mother made them biscuits and eggs for breakfast.  The two girls were too excited to sit still.  They didn't even watch any cartoons before they left for the zoo in the car.  The first thing they saw was a zoo worker carrying a pail of fish.  He was going to feed the penguins.  The penguins looked funny walking on land but were very fast swimmers in the water.  Next, the girls ran to where the pandas live.  The pandas were playing by rolling down the hill.  After watching the pandas, the girls and their father moved to where the lions were.  One lion was asleep on his back but the others were in a circle eating some meat.  It did not look tasty.  The girls didn't want to watch this any more so they walked to where the zebras were eating grass.  Rebecca thought it would be fun to ride one like a horse.
