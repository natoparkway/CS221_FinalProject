Once upon a time there was a cat named Pizza.  Pizza was black with four white feet and a brown tail.  Pizza had three friends.  They were Dig the dog, Mittens the rooster, and Bub the duck.  When they were in school one day, their teacher told them the story of the super scary sock monster.  She warned them to stay as far away from the sock monster as they could.  Wanting to show how brave they were, Pizza, Dig, Mittens, and Bub went off to take a picture of the sock monster.  Before they left, they each packed one type of fruit.  Pizza packed an apple.  Dig packed a pear.  Mittens packed a banana.  Bub packed a grape.  It took a long time but they finally found the sock monster.  He lived in a cave.  The cave was under the school.  The sock monster was not looking in their direction when they found him.  As quiet as they could, they walked up to him.  Pizza got the camera ready.  Just as Pizza was about to take the picture, Bub tripped over a stick.  The noise caused the sock monster to look at the brave friends.  The sock monster was angry!    "He looks mad!  What can we do?" wondered Mittens?    "Maybe he likes fruit." said Pizza, "Let's throw him the fruit we packed."  Pizza gave the sock monster his apple.  The sock monster didn't eat it.  Bub gave the sock monster his grape.  The sock monster didn't eat it.  Mittens gave the sock monster her banana.  The sock monster didn't eat it.  Dig gave the sock monster her pear.  The sock monster ate it!    "Thanks!" said the sock monster.  "I was really hungry.  Pears are my favorite."  No longer hungry, the sock monster let Pizza take a picture.  The brave friends returned to their teacher and showed her the picture.    "You are all very brave," said the teacher.  "But you didn't listen to me.  I am keeping the picture.  It is your punishment."  The brave friends were very sorry.
