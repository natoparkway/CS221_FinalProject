Sam wanted a phone, so he asked his Mom if he could have one because phones are very expensive. Sam told his Mom that he could do extra chores for money to buy one. Sam's Mom told him that a phone is very expensive, much more expensive than the toys he normally buys with his chore money. But Sam still really wanted a phone. Sam's Mom came up with an idea and told Sam to pray for one. Since she could not help him, maybe God could help him. That night Sam prayed before bed and asked if he could somehow have a phone. The next day Sam was playing bat and ball with his brother John and sister Lucy. He saw something shine from the ground. He found a phone lying there. He ran and took it to his Mom who checked the phone, and after a quick clean found the phone worked. She told Sam that someone must have lost the phone and she'll call them to tell them they have found the phone. Sam sat in the kitchen as Sam's Mom called the number in the phone. A lady called Pat answered. After telling the lady the story of Sam and his praying, the lady was so touched that she told Sam's Mom to give the phone to Sam.
