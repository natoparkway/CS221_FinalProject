Ginger and Joey were two young dogs. They were happy because it was now the summer and they could play outside more often. Today Ginger and Joey were running around in their big backyard. They had fun barking at many things. They barked at squirrels. They barked at a bus. They barked at the mailman. They barked at a weird bug. They barked so much, they were never quiet! The neighbor was a grumpy old man. His name was Bert. Bert threw a shoe at them because they were barking too much. He couldn't take a nap because they were so loud. Bert got too angry and Bert throws things when he gets too angry. The shoe missed both Ginger and Joey, but they barked a little less. Now they ran even faster. After a very long time, they began to get tired. They sniffed around the edges of the yard and found some old watermelon. That's a good snack for young dogs like Ginger and Joey! Next, they rolled around in the dirt. Then they chased their tails. Finally, their mom came out and told them to come inside. They were so dirty, they needed a bath. Ginger loved baths and jumped right into the tub. Joey was scared and ran away to hide. After a little bit, his mom found him and he got a bath in the end, too.
