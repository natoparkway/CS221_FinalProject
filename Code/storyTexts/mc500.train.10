Stinky Pete wanted to build a tree house.  He needed to get a ladder to bring wood up the tree.  He went to his friend's house to borrow a ladder.  He also borrowed a bucket.  He needed the bucket to carry nails.  His friend is named James.  The ladder was too big for Stinky Pete to carry alone.  He had James help him carry the ladder back home.  The ladder was heavy.  They were careful to stay on the sidewalk.  Stinky Pete got the hammer from his tool box.  He gave James a rope.  Stinky Pete and James got to work on the tree house.  They worked all day.  They painted the inside of the tree house blue.  They painted the outside of the tree house red.  They did not use green or orange paint.  They used the rope to climb down from the tree house.  When they were all finished, Stinky Pete helped James carry the ladder and bucket back to his house.   Stinky Pete thanked James for helping him.
