On Tuesday, Timmy went to go visit his grandma for the day. She lived in a town close to where Timmy lived, so Timmy got in the car and his mom drove him to his grandma's house. Timmy wanted to bring his big white dog with him, but his mom said no because his grandma doesn't like dogs. Instead, Timmy brought his favorite toys: a blue car, a puzzle with a picture of green trees on it, and a few fun board games in brown boxes. When Timmy got to his grandma's house, she was standing at the door waiting for him. She had a plate of cookies in her hands and was very excited to see him.   "Hi, Timmy!" She said.   "Hi, Grandma!" Timmy said. "I'm so happy to see you!"  Grandma smiled. "We're going to have so much fun today, Timmy. I have ham sandwiches, chips, and fresh lemonade for lunch, and I also have a whole plate of warm cookies all for you."  "Wow, Grandma, that sounds great! I brought some games for us to play. This is going to be a great day!"   Grandma and Timmy went inside Grandma's house and Timmy opened his bag of toys to show Grandma. She looked at the car, the puzzle, and the games, and then looked at Timmy.   "Well, Timmy, what do you want to do first?" She asked.   Timmy chose the puzzle, and they spent a few hours putting it together. Then, they ate lunch. The sandwiches, chips, lemonade and cookies are all delicious. Timmy ate three whole cookies by himself. After lunch, they played outside with the car, and then when they got tired, they sat on the porch and rested. It was starting to get dark out.   "I had a great day, Timmy," Grandma said.   Timmy smiled. "Me too, Grandma. I love spending time with you!" Timmy thought it had been a perfect day, even if he couldn't bring his dog.
