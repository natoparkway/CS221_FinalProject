There were four men who all played basketball. They did not play baseball, football, or soccer. Their names were Seth, Tanner, Henry, and Ryan. One of them had the best shot in the west. He was so good that he almost never missed a shot. Everyone in the world wanted to be as good as him. Tanner was the one who almost never missed a shot. He played basketball every day. He could shoot it, dribble it, and run very fast. He could not dunk it. He got so good at basketball, teams like the Hoopsters, the Shooters, the Dribblers, and the Dunkers tried to pick him. He had a very hard time choosing his team. He had to pick a team fast. They needed players so Tanner had to choose a team. He chose the Hoopsters. They were his best friends. Tanner played many games with them and was even their star player. He really enjoyed basketball and had a lot of fun playing the game. He had so much fun that he played it for a long time.
