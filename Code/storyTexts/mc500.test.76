Allie was trying to choose which costume she would wear for Halloween.  She did not want to dress up as a scary monster.  She could go as an angel all in white or as a rabbit with a basket of eggs.  She thought that wings would be too hard to make.  Allie went to ask her mom if she had any eggs to go in her basket.  Her mom said that the eggs might break and told her to use carrots instead.  Allie looked in the refrigerator but there were no carrots.  She took some spinach instead.   Allie got an old pillow case out of the hall closet.  She would use it to carry the candy she would get.  Allie's little sister, Grace, was going as a princess dressed in pink.  She had a shiny, silver purse on her arm.  Allie took Grace by the hand and led her down the sidewalk.  The first door they knocked on was answered by a woman dressed as witch with a tall, black hat on her head.  The witch gave both of the girls some candied apples.
