Once upon a time, there was a boy named Freddy.   And Freddy loved his mom very much, and his mom loved him very much too.  One day, Freddy went outside to ride his bike.  On the way out, his mother told him, "Remember to wear your helmet," and Freddy grabbed his helmet and met his friends outside.  When he was putting on his helmet, his friends told him, "Helmets are for girls!  You're not cool if you wear a helmet!"  Freddy thought about what his mom told him, but he wanted to be cool like his friends, and he took off his helmet.  Freddy and his friends went on a long adventure, and they rode all the way to the top of the largest hill in their neighborhood.  Looking down, Freddy was scared.  He had never ridden down this hill before.  His friends said, "What are you, scared?"  Freddy did not want to come off as scared.  He hopped on his bicycle, and down he went.  Freddy started speeding up, going very, very fast.  He pressed his brakes, but oh no, his brakes weren't working.  Freddy, speeding down the hill, did not know what to do.  He got to the end of the hill and slammed right into a tree.  He awoke the next day in the hospital.  At the hospital, his mother was there.  Freddy opened his eyes and told his mom the whole story.  He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his helmet.  His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right in the beginning.  She didn't have to say it.  In the end, Freddy learned that it's important to not care what other people think, and those that think you're not cool because you wear a helmet are the ones that aren't cool in the first place.
