Three cats named Daisy, Sofia, and Abby wanted to start a band. They put an ad in the newspaper because they needed a drummer. Daisy and Sofia would play guitar and sing. Bass would be played by Abby. A few weeks passed and no one called about the ad. Finally, one afternoon the telephone rang. A deep voice said, "Do you still need a drummer?" Daisy said, "Yes, come by this afternoon." Daisy got the other cats together and they set up their instruments and waited for the drummer to show up. Soon a dog came running up, pulling a set of drums behind him. "You're the drummer?" Sofia hissed. "Scram!" said Abby. But Daisy was more accepting. "C'mon guys, we need a drummer. Just let him play!" she said. "Okay," said Sofia and Abby. They started to jam. "We need to come up with a name," Sofia said, between songs. "How about 'Atomic Death Fish?'" said Abby. "No, too scary," said Sofia. "How about 'Monkeys on Mars?'" said Daisy. "Too goofy," said Sofia. "How about 'Sofia and the No Nos?'" said the drummer. "I love it!" everyone said.
