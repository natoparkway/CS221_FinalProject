Tony walked home from school on his birthday. He was surprised to see a lot of cars in front of his house. When he opened the door and entered the house, he heard a lot of people yell, "Surprise!" It was a surprise party for his birthday.  His parents called all his friends' parents and invited them to come to a party for Tony. Tony did not know anything about it. It was really a surprise to him. His best friends Jim and Melissa were there. Martha and Phil were there, too. There were about 20 kids at the party, and some of their parents were there, too.  After a few hours, Tony started to open his presents. He got a new shirt, a basketball, and a book about dinosaurs. Finally, he opened the last present, which was from his parents. It was a blue bicycle. Tony was happy, because that was what he wanted the most.  After the presents were opened, all the kids started to get tired. They left one by one with their parents. Tony was tired also, because it was a big day for him. Finally, he went to bed and dreamed about all the cool presents he got.
