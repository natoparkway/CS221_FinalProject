Molly and her friend Jessica liked to play hide and go seek in the woods.  They would almost always play in the woods behind Molly's house. They liked to play there because of the giant trees, which were more fun to play in at nighttime. One evening, after a big meal of chicken and potatoes at Molly's house the girls went outside to play hide and go seek. They almost turned back because they thought they saw a wolf. Luckily, it ended up being a shadow from an old boot. Jessica counted to fifty to give Molly time to hide. In the middle of counting, Jessica heard a sound! Jessica opened up her eyes to see Molly had found a puppy! The puppy had a bell on its collar, so the girls knew it must belong to someone. They carried the puppy back to Molly's house instead of playing hide and go seek. As soon as they got to Molly's front door, Molly's neighbor saw them and screamed with joy. The puppy ran over to Molly's neighbor and licked her face. The neighbor thanked the two girls by giving them each a folded five dollar bill. The girls were very excited that they helped save the day!
