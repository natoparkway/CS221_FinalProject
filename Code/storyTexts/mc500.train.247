Zebras cannot clap. However, one weekend a magic clown wiggled his nose and said a few magical words and a zebra could clap. This zebra lived in a zoo with many other zebras. This zebra's name was John, John the Zebra. John was so excited that he could clap. He tried to clap as much as he could. He had trouble understanding when and what to clap. He would clap at things that were sad and things that were happy. He clapped when he was excited and when he was scared. He even clapped that he could clap. After a couple of weeks, his friend Sam was getting annoyed with John. He said "John, I know you like clapping but I am beginning to be annoyed by your clapping." John said he was sorry, but that Sam did not understand how special it was to be the first Zebra that could clap. A few more weeks went by and the same Magical clown came by John's zoo. He looked at John, who was clapping his heart out, and wiggled his nose and said some different magical words. Suddenly, John could not clap any more. And that month was first and only time a zebra could clap.
