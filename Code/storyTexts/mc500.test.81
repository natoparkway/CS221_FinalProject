Susie the spider was a small little spider. Her brother Steve was bigger than her. Her mother Sally was even bigger than Steve. Her father Stewart was bigger than Steve too, but wasn't the biggest spider of the family. When Susie got mad, she would kick her brother Steve. Even if Steve was bigger than Susie he would yell and run away. Steve was always getting mad at Susie, because she got all the attention. Even when Steve would do all the washing, sweep the floor and clean the sink, still he didn't get any attention. All Sally had to do was suck her thumb and look cute. Sally was better at reading than Steve and he thought this was why he didn't get as much attention. Susie was younger, but smarter than Steve. Steve didn't think this was fair, because even if he wasn't as smart, he worked hard and was always a good spider.
