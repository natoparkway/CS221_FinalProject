Sally wants to learn how to cook. She has only made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches before.  Today she is going to try to make some spaghetti with meat sauce.  First she goes to the store down the street to buy the food. She buys six tomatoes, some beef, seasoning, one box of pasta and ten pieces of fruit.  When she gets home she goes to the kitchen and starts boiling some water. The water takes four hundred seconds to boil.  Next, she cuts up the beef and puts it in a pan to fry it. When the beef is cooked she starts to cut the tomatoes. When she is finished with the tomatoes she puts them in the pan and puts a lid on top. Once the tomatoes get hot she adds the seasoning and mixes the sauce.  Finally she adds the cooked pasta to the sauce. Sally thinks that her spaghetti with meat sauce smells really good! She takes some to the table and starts eating her dinner. Her table is in the dining room. Sally wants to cook more foods tomorrow, maybe she'll make some fried rice!
