A small boy named John was at the park one day.  He was swinging on the swings and his Tim friend played on the slide.  John wanted to play on the slide now.  John asked Tim if he could play on the slide.  Tim said no.  John was very upset and started crying.  A girl named Susan saw him crying. Susan told the teacher Ms. Tammy.  Ms. Tammy came over and told John that they could both take turns on the slide.  John and Tim were OK with this. They both took turns on the slide. They all lived happily ever after.
