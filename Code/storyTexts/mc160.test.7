Paul woke up at 8. He was very happy because today he got to go to his favorite thing, the fair. Paul's mother Beth was taking him to the fair. After finishing breakfast at 9, Paul got in the car with his mom. At 10 they got to Jim's house to pick him up. Jim was Paul's best friend. Then at 11, they picked up Beth's boyfriend Hank. After driving for one more hour they all finally got to the fair at 12. They had all been looking forward to this for a very long time. Beth was a bit annoyed by having to drive so much to get here, but she loved her son very much so the trouble was okay. Everyone had a great time, most of all, Paul. Gail's favorite ride was Ferris. Hank's favorite ride was the Ghoster. It was very scary. Paul's favorite ride was the same as Hank's.
