Joey went to a baseball game during the winter this year. He went by himself knowing he would enjoy the game much more than if he had gone with his friends Sam, Mark and David. His friends like to talk and hang out more than watch the game itself. The game was very exciting; Joey sat at the edge of his chair the whole game. The game ended with his home team winning by one run. The screams of the fans could be heard from very far away. On his way home he stopped at a dinner to have some dinner. When eating he saw some other fans come in and start belting out some songs and laughing. After dinner he looked at the menu and wanted some dessert. His choices were marshmallow and chocolate cake, apple pie with ice cream, warm brownies with ice cream, or a vanilla shake. He loved the taste of marshmallow so he went with that. On his way home he thought someone was tailing him so he turned off into a coffee store. When they drove by he went home.
