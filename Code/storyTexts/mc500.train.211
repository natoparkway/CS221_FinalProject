It was a beautiful day.  In the morning Tommy and I went to the park to play. We rode our bikes around and went down to the lake. We swam around in the lake and splashed water on other kids. We got back on our bikes and rode back home. Mommy made lunch. It was yummy, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and milk. Then it was time for our nap. We woke up and watched some TV. Mommy gave us some money for candy later.  Tommy and I went back to the park to play. Tommy and I played with a baseball with some other kids. Then we played with the football. We went to the store across the street. We bought some candy with the money Mommy gave us. We went back to the park and watched the other kids play as we ate our candy. It was hot, so we went swimming again.  It was fun! We like swimming so we go swimming almost every day. We swam all afternoon until Mommy came down to the park at told us to come home. Mommy was very upset because we were gone so long. Mommy was worried that something might have happened to us. Mommy was not paying attention to her kids and what they were doing for hours.  Tommy and I told Mommy she needs to pay more attention to us. Mommy started crying, then Tommy and I started crying. Mommy said from now on, I must pay more attention to you two.  Daddy came home from work and playing softball for his company team. Daddy wanted to know what was going on. Daddy saw that we were all crying. Daddy started to cry too. We all said that we would pay more attention to each other. We all said that we would do more things together like going to the park. We all said we would eat together more often.
