It was almost Kira's birthday and Halloween. Kira wanted to paint pumpkins at the circus, but she was sick in bed. She had broken her leg earlier and now all of her leg hurt, even her toes. She had hurried when she had crossed the road, and slipped and ended up going to the hospital. Because she was not being careful enough, she was stuck in bed, eating crackers and watching television. Just as Kira was on her fourth hour of television, her mother knocked on her door. "Kira," she said. "Your friends are here." Kira looked up to see her two best friends, Lexie and Jamie. They were grinning. "Kira," Lexie said, "We got you something." When they entered, Kira saw that they had a giant pumpkin with them. Jamie was carrying a set of paints and paintbrushes. "Aww," Kira said. "Thank you, guys." "Duh," Lexie said. "What are friends for?"
