The road to Grandpa's house was long and winding. There were lots of tall trees and animals in the woods. The trip took a long time because Jimmy was walking in his new boots and he wasn't used to them yet. He could have taken a ride to Grandpa's house, but that wouldn't be as fun. Jimmy liked to collect insects on the way to his Grandpa's house, so had picked the longer path.   As he went along, Jimmy found more and more insects to add to his jar. His favorite was the lightning bug and he had found five of them total. He liked the moths too, but they were difficult to catch and took up a lot of space.  Finally, Jimmy arrived at Grandpa's house and knocked. Grandpa answered the door with a smile and welcomed Jimmy inside. They sat by the fire and talked about the insects. They watched the lightning bugs light up as night came.
