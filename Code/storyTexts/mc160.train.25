School is out for the summer.  Jake and Jimmy are playing on a baseball team. They are both nine years old this year.  Their team is called the Knights.  Jake plays first base and Jimmy is a pitcher.  They both love baseball.  They started playing when they were four years old.  It is so fun for them.  Their team has won three games so far.  They beat the Jets, the Bluejays, and the Hawks so far.  They have not lost any games yet.  They are playing the Tigers today.  The Tigers have not lost any games either.  The score was one to one until the last inning.  There were two outs.  Jimmy came to the plate.  The pitcher named Johnny threw the ball hard.  Jimmy swung his bat too late and missed.  He missed the next pitch too.  It was too fast.  He was ready for the next pitch.  He hit it hard to center field.  The Tiger player in center field jumped to catch it, but it went over his head and over the fence.  It was a home run!  The Knights won the game!
