Ralph was an alligator that loved to splash around in the water. Ralph had three brothers, named Henry, Larry, and Thomas. But none of Ralph's three brothers liked to play in the water. They were very mean brothers, but the meanest of them all was Henry. Henry would always chase Ralph around the lake and try to beat him up when he was splashing around. Then on his birthday, Ralph thought of a great idea. His idea was to stop Henry from beating him by using a trick. He would trick Henry into thinking one side of the lake was scary. Ralph dressed up in a spooky costume and waited for Henry to swim over to the side of the lake. Then when Henry came over, Ralph started making spooky sounds and scared Henry back to the other side of the lake. Henry was so scared he never came to the other side of the lake again and Ralph was free to splash around in peace.
