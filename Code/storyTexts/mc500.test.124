In a big forest lived a fox named Manny. He was having a fun morning. Dad had given him a cookie as a snack and it was yummy! Now he was wandering through the woods, looking for an adventure. After a little bit he came across a frog sitting on a log. They looked at each other, but did not say anything. Manny spoke first. "Hi there, my name is Manny and I'm a fox. Who are you?" The frog on the log didn't answer at first. He finally said, "My name is Tony and I'm a frog. My brother could beat you up." Manny was very surprised to hear this. First, why would a frog's brother want to fight him? Second, how could some little frog beat him up? Manny told Tony he didn't think he would want to fight his brother because he would hurt him. Tony jumped off the log and hopped away, shouting over his shoulder, "You're a liar! My brother can beat up anyone!" As the frog went away, Manny was very confused. He didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but the frog was sad because of what Manny said. Manny also did not like to be called a liar, so he ran after the frog. He soon found out that Tony's brother was not from the same mother. His brother was a brown bear named Greg. After taking a good look at Greg, Manny said yes, Greg could beat up anyone he chose. After that day all three of them became close friends.
