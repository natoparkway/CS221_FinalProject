Rose and Lily were best friends. They had met when they were little and grew up together. Lily and Rose got a house to live in and painted the walls blue. Then they went to buy a couch. Jerry worked at the couch store. Lily found a green couch that she liked. But the couch was too hard. Rose found a soft red couch. She showed it to Lilly and they both thought it was very soft. Jerry said he would help them move it and let them buy the couch. Rose and Lily went to another store to buy extra cushions. Tom worked at the store that had a lot of pillows to buy. Rose and Lily did not think Tom was nice. Tom did not help them. Rose found red pillows but Tom would not give them to her. Lily found pretty green pillows but Tom said they cost a lot of money. Rose and Lily went to another store where they met Steve and Megan. Steve and Megan showed them a lot of pillows that were nice. Rose and Lily showed Megan and Steve the couch they had. Megan and Steve helped find pretty blue pillows for the red couch.  Rose and Lily were so happy they threw a party. Megan and Steve went to the party. Jerry went too. Jerry went to the party and gave Megan and Lily a rug. It was blue.  The rug matched the pillows.
