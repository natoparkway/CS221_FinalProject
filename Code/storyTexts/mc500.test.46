There was once a little boy named Jacob, who owned a dog named Pet. One day, Jacob was taking Pet outside to play. He picked up her favorite toy frog. When he did, he hit his elbow on the table. Ouch! He rubbed his elbow and frowned. Then he put his shoes on his feet, washed his hands, put on a jacket.  Jacob felt better, and went to open the door to the back yard. He walked outside. Once he got outside, he felt the cool breeze and the warm sun. They made him feel sleepy. He thought he would take a nap outside on the deck. He pushed two chairs together to make a bed. He climbed up and lay down. He used Pet's toy frog as a pillow. He lay his head on it. Pet curled up next to the chairs to take a nap too.   While Jacob and Pet slept, a bumblebee came flying by. It made a sleepy humming noise, and thought that the deck looked like a nice place to take a nap. A robin who had been following the bumblebee stopped too. The robin and the bee snuggled up together on the picnic table.  Jacob's mother looked out the window and saw Jacob, Pet, the bumblebee, and the robin all sleeping. "What a peaceful group," she thought. And then she yawned and said, "Now I am feeling sleepy too!"
