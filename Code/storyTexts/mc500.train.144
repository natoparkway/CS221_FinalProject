There was once an animal named Eddy. He was not a dog, a bunny or a bear but a little kitten. Unlike the black, white and orange cats in his neighborhood, Eddy was a gray cat. He loved to go outside and run around the streets and the city. He liked to listen to the birds chirp and watch the children draw with chalk. He was a very smart and friendly kitten.  Eddy was good at many things. He was good at hopping, running and playing. The thing Eddy was best at was climbing! His claws gripped trees hard which made it easy for him to pull himself up. Anyone who saw Eddy climb might think he was part monkey!  Eddy also loved his family. When he wasn't outside he liked to sit with people when they would read, play with toys and eat. Eddy was a very lazy cat! He loved to sleep most of the day, at least 12 hours! His family could always count on him to be sleepy.
