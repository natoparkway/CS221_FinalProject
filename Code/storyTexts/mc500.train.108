Ally wanted to bake a cake for her best friend Kelly's birthday. Ally called her friend Melissa saying that she needed Melissa's help to make the cake. Melissa wanted to bake cookies and cupcakes too. Ally said that was okay and to buy everything. Melissa went to the store and bought everything. Melissa went to Ally's house and they started to make the cake. After baking the cake, they started making cookies and cupcakes. The house smelled great. They had a lot of fun baking. After cleaning up, they called Kelly to come over to Ally's house and surprise her for her birthday. Kelly was surprised and so was their friend Shannon. The girls ate the cake and snacked on the cookies and cupcakes. The ladies laughed and talked as they ate. After eating, they watched a movie on Ally's TV. It was a good movie and the ladies all laughed and talked about it after. Kelly and Shannon left Ally's house to go home. Melissa and Ally said bye and had big smiles. It was a great day, and Ally was happy.
