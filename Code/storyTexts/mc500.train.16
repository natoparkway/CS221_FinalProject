Dave and John were playing catch in the living room.  Rose told them that was dumb, but she did not stop them.  She kept writing in her notebook. If they wanted to get in trouble, then they could.  It was not her responsibility.  Dave told John to go long.  Dave did not have good aim and missed John's hands when he threw the ball.  Instead he hit the lamp and knocked it over.  He was glad he did not hit the dishes.  Nor did he hit the cat.  John was not glad that he hit the lamp, but was glad that the lamp was not broken.  When John's dad came home, he was very happy that John came clean about the lamp even when it was not broken.  After telling them off for playing inside, John's dad made them all a cake.  The cake had lemon frosting, which was Dave's favorite.  Rose cannot eat lemon, so she let Dave have her slice.  He chose to take Rose's cake home to his Bro.  Dave thanked her a lot.
