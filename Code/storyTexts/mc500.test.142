John was very hungry.  So he chose to make a sandwich.  John invited Susan, Tim, and Jack over to help him.  They all pulled out bread, lettuce, tomato, meat, pickle, and cheese. Cheese is Johns favorite food.  One at a time, they each put one ingredient on the sandwich. John put the bread down.  Tim put the tomato down. Susan put the meat down. Jack put the lettuce down. John also put the cheese down. Susan put the pickle down. After they finished, John ate his sandwich and it was delicious.
