Jon was very excited to go to the park. His dad always takes him to the park to play ball. He plays baseball with all his friends. When he got to the park Jon saw his friend Joe. Joe had brought his new puppy to the park. The puppy was very cute. It was a white dog with black spots. Jon really liked Joe's new dog, so did their other friends Janet and Jake. Jon jumped up and down and told his dad how cool the dog was. The next day when Jon's dad came home he had a brown box with him. He told Jon he had a surprise for him. Jon was so excited he couldn't even sit still. When Jon's dad put the box down it began to move. Jon was a little scared but also really excited to see what was in the box. When Jon pulled open the top of the box a very small white dog, covered in black spots, jumped out of the box and into Jon's lap and began to lick his face. Jon was so excited, he named the dog Jack.
