Steve took his family to the lake. There are a lot of things to do at the lake. Steve's favorite thing to do is ride in his red boat across the blue water. The boat is very loud and makes dark brown smoke. The boat can go very fast.  Steve has a son named Bobby. Bobby doesn't like riding in the boat, he prefers to sit on the shore and make lunch. He makes sandwiches for the whole family. Bobby loves eating ham sandwiches, but Steve prefers turkey sandwiches.  Bobby's mom also likes to eat ham sandwiches.  Bobby also has a younger sister named Mary. Mary doesn't like eating sandwiches so she brings one cup of soup and some chips for her lunch.  Mary enjoys fishing at the lake.  She caught two yellow fish, five pink fish and three blue fish.  Mary wants to cook the fish for dinner.  Bobby's mom likes to wear her favorite orange hat.  Her hat also has a big purple flower on top. She got the hat from Billy who works at the big store down the street.  After Steve's family leaves the lake they all want to go home and eat dinner. Playing at the lake makes them all very hungry!
