Text: my parents, kelly and kelley, said that it was that time of year to take a family vacation.  we've been to big ride parks that have hotels with large pools.  this year my parents wanted to do something different.  they wanted to take us all to elk river castle.  after lots of planning we hit the road for our trip.  my brother kelsey and i enjoyed the long car ride there.    once we arrive, the castle looked much bigger than we had imagined.  there was so much to see and so much to do.  there was a swimming pool, movie theater and an elevator to take us from floor to floor.  what a magical place!  i was so excited because we had the whole place to our family!    we spent our vacation playing around the huge castle and finding small mysterious places. there was even a tiny room in the back of one of the closets.  my brother, kelsey, and i played hide and go seek for hours, watched movies and swam until the sun went down.  it was sad when our vacation finally came to an end but we made some amazing memories. we'll never forget our trip to elk river castle!

"olive, may i please borrow a pair of your socks?" she asked.  olive the owl looked surprised. "luna, i have no use for socks because my legs and toes have thick feathers. go visit one of the animals that walk on four legs. they might have extra socks you could borrow."  luna flew across the field and landed next to the icy creek. rose the raccoon was teaching her six babies how to wash their paws. the water was very cold, but the babies were having fun.  "rose, my bare legs and bare toes are so cold, may i please borrow a pair of your socks?" begged luna.  rose laughed hard. "silly luna, i do not have socks. look at my legs and feet. they are covered with thick, warm fur. i'm sorry i cannot help you. go visit the humans. sometimes i tip over their garbage cans at night when i am looking for food. once i saw a pair of socks."  luna was very afraid of humans. her grandmother and mother had warned her about them. she was told that some humans are mean and hurt hawks. her feet were so cold that it was difficult to grip tree branches. she became brave. she flew to the farmhouse on the big hill. when she landed on the roof, she could not believe her eyes. she saw socks! in late autumn, henrietta the human had put laundry outside to dry and she had forgotten to bring in one tiny pair of socks. the socks were hanging on the clothesline by two wooden pins. luna used her powerful beak to break the pins. she put on the socks and then flew back to her home in the huge tree. when she landed, her feet were warm and dry. luna was very happy.

Text: it was a beautiful sunny and warm day. i was working outside in my garden. i was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but i was enjoying the day. i live by a lake so sometimes i take a break from my chores and look at the lake. it is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals i can find swimming in or near the lake.  on this day, i kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. i got up from my garden and walked to the lake. i kept hearing this strange sound. it sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. i thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. the lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" to other lake birds. there is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud. but this sound was not like any i had ever heard. i went to get the binoculars to see if i could spot anything. but, no luck. i still kept hearing this low talking sound. i had now totally given up weeding. finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. but where was it coming from? i looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. finally i went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. there is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. i spotted them! it was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. they were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. the low talking sound that i heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. i sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. i felt very special that i got to see this. it was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.

Text: it was a beautiful sunny and warm day. i was working outside in my garden. i was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but i was enjoying the day. i live by a lake so sometimes i take a break from my chores and look at the lake. it is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals i can find swimming in or near the lake.  on this day, i kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. i got up from my garden and walked to the lake. i kept hearing this strange sound. it sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. i thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. the lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" to other lake birds. there is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud. but this sound was not like any i had ever heard. i went to get the binoculars to see if i could spot anything. but, no luck. i still kept hearing this low talking sound. i had now totally given up weeding. finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. but where was it coming from? i looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. finally i went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. there is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. i spotted them! it was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. they were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. the low talking sound that i heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. i sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. i felt very special that i got to see this. it was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.
Question: how did i feel at the end of the story?: i, feel

Text: once there was a young boy named bret who had a cat named wolfgang.  the boy had really wanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked to blow things down and they snored.  so the boy had to call his cat wolfie.  he had also thought about naming his cat sir purrsalot.  bret himself planned to become a knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought sir purrsalot sounded like a good name for his brother knight.  the difficulty there was that wolfie didn't purr a lot.  he purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.  plus bret's mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the bathroom and they clanked.  so bret was left with a cat named wolfgang.  the neighbors gave him strange looks when he stood in the front yard in the evening and yelled "wolfie!  here wolfie!!!", to get wolfgang to come in for the night.  but bret didn't care what anyone else thought.  he had a wolfie and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.

Text: once upon a time, there was a dog named puddles. puddles was lonely because he lived in an area where there were no other dogs, but only cats. day after day, puddles would have to eat cat food and do cat things in order to fit in with the rest of his group. he found it very boring and puddles was sad. puddles didn't even look like a cat!  all of the other cats teased puddles. "you're too big," they said. "you've got too long of a nose!" "why are you panting like that?" puddles knew that he was different.  one day, puddles chose to run away from all of the cats. the cats laughed at him. what a stupid dog! didn't he know that there were monsters in the woods that could eat him? puddles didn't care, because puddles was sad enough to try.  so puddles packed up his things - his squeaky ball, his water dish, and his bone - and headed off into the woods. he was finally happy! all of a sudden, puddles turned. he smelled a funny smell. it smelled like something he had never smelled before. he turned around, and what did he see but another dog!  puddles was so happy, he barked with joy. he went home with the other dog, who was named mittens, and to his family. puddles was never lonely again.
