Text: it was a beautiful sunny and warm day. i was working outside in my garden. i was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but i was enjoying the day. i live by a lake so sometimes i take a break from my chores and look at the lake. it is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals i can find swimming in or near the lake.  on this day, i kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. i got up from my garden and walked to the lake. i kept hearing this strange sound. it sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. i thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. the lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" to other lake birds. there is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud. but this sound was not like any i had ever heard. i went to get the binoculars to see if i could spot anything. but, no luck. i still kept hearing this low talking sound. i had now totally given up weeding. finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. but where was it coming from? i looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. finally i went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. there is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. i spotted them! it was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. they were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. the low talking sound that i heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. i sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. i felt very special that i got to see this. it was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.

Text: once there was a young boy named bret who had a cat named wolfgang.  the boy had really wanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked to blow things down and they snored.  so the boy had to call his cat wolfie.  he had also thought about naming his cat sir purrsalot.  bret himself planned to become a knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought sir purrsalot sounded like a good name for his brother knight.  the difficulty there was that wolfie didn't purr a lot.  he purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.  plus bret's mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the bathroom and they clanked.  so bret was left with a cat named wolfgang.  the neighbors gave him strange looks when he stood in the front yard in the evening and yelled "wolfie!  here wolfie!!!", to get wolfgang to come in for the night.  but bret didn't care what anyone else thought.  he had a wolfie and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.
