Text: one sunny morning, stewart chose to go to the beach. he knew that a rainstorm was going to arrive on saturday and wanted to enjoy some sun before it arrived.   stewart laid on his belly and began reading his newspaper. as he was enjoying the sun and the newspaper, he saw a bug crawl across his blanket. at first stewart thought it was an ant, but the bug was moving too slowly to be an ant. as stewart leaned in for a closer look, the bug cried out, "excuse me, sir! can you help me?" stewart was surprised and jumped to his feet. "you can talk!" he shouted. "yes," said the bug. "please help me! as you might know, there is a rainstorm coming into town. unfortunately, i do not have a place to call home. i need to find somewhere to sleep before the rain washes me away!" stewart felt sad. "gee," he cried. "that sounds terrible!"  stewart thought about the problem. "perhaps you can stay at my house," he said. the bug jumped for joy and said, "oh, that would be wonderful!" the two traveled back to stewart's house and the bug found a soft spot to sleep.  the next day, the sky had darkened and rain clouds appeared all over town. just as the news had said, a rainstorm had arrived. when stewart woke up, he looked for the bug but could not find him. then, he saw something flying around his house. "thank you for letting me sleep here last night," said the butterfly. it was the bug! "i knew i could not change into a butterfly if i was out in the rain. i won't forget your kindness." after speaking, the butterfly flew away. stewart stood in his doorway and shouted, "goodbye!"

Text: it was a cold day when john made up his mind to go outside and check the fence.  there had been things missing from the back yard, and he was starting to think there was a criminal at work.  he put on his coat and started walking through the snow back to the long metal fence at the back of the yard.  it seemed like a lot longer walk than last summer when it was hot.  sure enough, he found how the crook had gotten in.  a tree, weighted down by the snow, had fallen on the fence on a windy day and broken a section.  he got out his toolbox, and with a tool, cut some sections of wire.  he used the wires to fix the fence.  now, it was time to catch the crook.  sure enough, he saw tracks heading to and from the fence.  but they weren't a crook's footprints.  it had been a raccoon that had been stealing things from his yard.

Text: it was a cold day when john made up his mind to go outside and check the fence.  there had been things missing from the back yard, and he was starting to think there was a criminal at work.  he put on his coat and started walking through the snow back to the long metal fence at the back of the yard.  it seemed like a lot longer walk than last summer when it was hot.  sure enough, he found how the crook had gotten in.  a tree, weighted down by the snow, had fallen on the fence on a windy day and broken a section.  he got out his toolbox, and with a tool, cut some sections of wire.  he used the wires to fix the fence.  now, it was time to catch the crook.  sure enough, he saw tracks heading to and from the fence.  but they weren't a crook's footprints.  it had been a raccoon that had been stealing things from his yard.

Text: thunder can move a seesaw. this is very important to know if you ever see what i saw. one day, i was walking home when i saw a squirrel on a seesaw near my house. it was running up and down, and all around, playing by itself. suddenly, an ox appeared from nowhere. it came up to the squirrel, walked around the seesaw for a bit, then sat down on one end. as you know, an ox is a very big animal, so the seesaw threw the squirrel off and high into the air! the squirrel flew so high that it passed the buildings. it passed the birds, it passed the planes and stopped in the clouds. when it was there, it made friends with the clouds and asked one of the clouds a secret question. the cloud said okay, and sent the squirrel back to the ground. the squirrel fell and fell for a long time. finally he landed on the seesaw, but the ox didn't move. "where were you?" the ox asked, "just talking with a friend," answered the mouse. i was watching and listening to everything, so i stayed, waiting. soon enough, a loud clap of thunder came from the clouds and threw the ox off of the seesaw and far, far away. so, you see, thunder can move a seesaw.

Text: pester came running into the room. he came to a fast stop when he saw the dog. he'd seen a dog before, every cat has, and he used to live with a black dog named henry, but he'd never seen a brown one before. it seemed strange to him, but not as strange as it was to see linda the brown chicken in the living room last spring. that still confused him.   he thought he liked this dog, not because of the color, but because it was small. and it was so hairy. it was a like a mop that could run around. he jumped on his favorite chair and looked down as maggie ran under it. she was kind of cute for a dog, pester thought to himself. he layed down on the chair and pawed at her as she ran in a circle under it. he tapped her ears as she went by, and waved his tail like a flag trying to get her attention. after a little more of this, pester curled up in a ball on the chair and took a nap.

Text: pester came running into the room. he came to a fast stop when he saw the dog. he'd seen a dog before, every cat has, and he used to live with a black dog named henry, but he'd never seen a brown one before. it seemed strange to him, but not as strange as it was to see linda the brown chicken in the living room last spring. that still confused him.   he thought he liked this dog, not because of the color, but because it was small. and it was so hairy. it was a like a mop that could run around. he jumped on his favorite chair and looked down as maggie ran under it. she was kind of cute for a dog, pester thought to himself. he layed down on the chair and pawed at her as she ran in a circle under it. he tapped her ears as she went by, and waved his tail like a flag trying to get her attention. after a little more of this, pester curled up in a ball on the chair and took a nap.

Text: one day, a pink moon was looking down at an empty sand land. although the pink moon could see all the lizards and cacti in the empty sand land, nobody could see the moon! the pink moon felt so lonely. so, the pink moon called on the sun for help. the great sun was very busy high in the sky, for it was his job to shine over the sand land, and it was hard to get his attention. so the moon wiggled closer and closer to the sun every second. the second turned to hours as the pink moon inched toward his friend, slowly moving across the sky. finally, the sun saw the moon and asked, "pink moon! what are you doing here? don't you know the sky is my home during the day? your time is coming soon enough. look, i'm falling now toward my bed on the end of the earth..." but the pink moon could not be stopped and kept moving toward the great sun.

Text: one morning, i woke up and went downstairs for breakfast. i fixed my normal breakfast: hot pickles, marshmallows, and ketchup. first i heat up the pickles on the stove, then i put the marshmallows in the toaster as i pour out my small plate of ketchup. delicious! i eat it every morning, often with a tall glass of lemonade.  i sat down at the table to eat, and looked out the window at the birds in my yard. sometimes i see skunks outside, and once i saw a small pot-bellied pig. but today there were only a few flamingos. i opened up the book i was reading, "all about birds." i had finished the chapter on pigeons, and was moving on to robins.  while putting ketchup on my marshmallows, i felt something tickling my neck. i looked down, and there was a daddy long-legs, climbing up! i had never seen one so close to my face.   "er, what's up?" i asked.   "not much," he said. "i smelled the hot pickles, and wanted to have a taste."  "sure, little guy," i said. i put a small piece of pickle on my finger and held it out. while i was doing that, that sneaky daddy-long-legs ran down my arm. he grabbed the rest of my pickle, and ran out the door! and that was the last time i gave a pickle to a spider at breakfast.

Text: once upon a time i had a dog named toodles. he was black and white and had long floppy ears. he also had very short legs, but really big paws. every saturday we would go to the park and play toodles' favorite game. toodles loved playing fetch. one saturday, toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. he ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. the ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. toodles wasn't having it! he jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. one of the ducks, braver than the others, poked toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. soaking wet, he ran toward where i was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so i could make him feel better. after that, whenever he would see a duck, toodles would run the other way.
Question: why did toodles curl up in my lap?
****a)so i could make him feel better.	2.10064291577
b)because i was tired.	1.86916740295
c)because he wanted to go home.	1.85410295484

Text: "i don't think i can win the race" tim told his parents over breakfast. his mother asked "why not?" but his father was silent. tim knew his father didn't believe he could be a racer: only last year, he had sent tim to a doctor to ask why his son wasn't a better runner. the doctor told him tim could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he didn't like to run.   tim, who had always preferred a good book to p.e. class, wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be, so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school's spring fun run.   tim answered, "i'm going to try to win, but angela is so quick! no one ever beats her at recess."   "well, we'll be there for you, either way" his mother said.  tim took an apple and walked to the bus. since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. he didn't even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named simon that tim sometimes pretended to be.  3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin. all the other students had brought running shorts, but tim was going to have to run in his school pants. suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. as he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. by the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him.   it was almost 4:00 before tim saw the end of the run. by the time tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. tim's father asked, "what took you so long? i'm surprised to see you here at all! why did you sign up for this when we all knew you wouldn't win?"   tim thought about why he signed up. it wasn't about winning the race, or making his father proud. it was about finishing, and showing himself that the doctor was right: he could be anything he wanted to be, like his favorite character, simon.
Question: why does tim start out so far behind?

Text: john wanted to have a birthday party for his son, mike. john and his wife sara knew that their son loved clowns, as did their daughter jane. so they looked up a place to have a clown come to his birthday party. when the clown arrived, ten of mikes friends showed up to watch the show. his parents had sent out 12 invites, thinking 6 or 8 kids would come. the clown started the show by squirting some water from a flower into john's face. this caused john's face to turn red. after the show, when everyone had left, it was up to john and sara to clean up after the party. there was food everywhere; they had had salad and there was lettuce on the ground. later that evening it was dinnertime and the family had to choose what to eat. the choices were order a pizza, make hamburgers, go get fried chicken or make noodles. since it was mike's birthday they let him choose. he really wanted pizza so they called up pizza palace to place their order. when the pizza arrived it did not come in a square box like most pizzas. instead it was in a round box that no one had ever seen. john gave everybody a slice and then placed mike in his lap to eat dinner.

Text: there once was a little monkey who lived in a zoo. he was a tiny brown monkey, smaller than all of the others. he was quieter than the others too. he was so quiet, in fact, that his mommy monkey made him wear a small blue bell around his neck so that she could find him. even when the little monkey was very quiet, whenever he moved, the bell would jingle and his mother could find him.  one day, this little monkey had been running around under the yellow sun for a long time, with his bell going "jingle jingle." he started to feel tired. but the other monkeys were still having fun and making a lot of noise. they were yelling and banging things together. the little monkey wanted to find somewhere quiet.  finally, he knew what to do: he took off his blue bell. he hung it on a branch. then he sneaked out of his cage in the zoo. he waited. he was very quiet and small. he waited until a young girl came walking through the zoo. she was with her mother and father. then he jumped into her red backpack. he was so small that she didn't know he was there. the girl and her mother and father got in their car and went home.  when the girl got home, she set down her backpack. her brother thought he saw her backpack moving. her sister thought she heard something. but nobody knew that a tiny, sleepy monkey had come home from the zoo. he was happily sleeping in the girl's backpack in her quiet house, away from all the other noisy monkeys.

Text: it was a beautiful sunny and warm day. i was working outside in my garden. i was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but i was enjoying the day. i live by a lake so sometimes i take a break from my chores and look at the lake. it is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals i can find swimming in or near the lake.  on this day, i kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. i got up from my garden and walked to the lake. i kept hearing this strange sound. it sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. i thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. the lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" to other lake birds. there is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud. but this sound was not like any i had ever heard. i went to get the binoculars to see if i could spot anything. but, no luck. i still kept hearing this low talking sound. i had now totally given up weeding. finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. but where was it coming from? i looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. finally i went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. there is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. i spotted them! it was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. they were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. the low talking sound that i heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. i sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. i felt very special that i got to see this. it was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.

Text: once there was a young boy named bret who had a cat named wolfgang.  the boy had really wanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked to blow things down and they snored.  so the boy had to call his cat wolfie.  he had also thought about naming his cat sir purrsalot.  bret himself planned to become a knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought sir purrsalot sounded like a good name for his brother knight.  the difficulty there was that wolfie didn't purr a lot.  he purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.  plus bret's mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the bathroom and they clanked.  so bret was left with a cat named wolfgang.  the neighbors gave him strange looks when he stood in the front yard in the evening and yelled "wolfie!  here wolfie!!!", to get wolfgang to come in for the night.  but bret didn't care what anyone else thought.  he had a wolfie and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.
