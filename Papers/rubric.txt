Task definition: is the task precisely defined and does the formulation make sense?

Approach: was a baseline, an oracle, and an advanced method described clearly, well justified, and tested?

Data and experiments: have you explained the data clearly, performed systematic experiments, and reported concrete results?

Analysis: did you interpret the results and try to explain why things worked (or didn't work) the way they did? Do you show concrete examples?

Extra credit: does the project present interesting and novel ideas (i.e., would this be publishable at a good conference)?
