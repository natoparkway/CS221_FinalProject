Towards AI-Complete Question Answering: A Set of Prerequisite Toy Tasks
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05698.pdf

INTRODUCTION
There hasn't been that much supervised machine learning in this space due to a lack of large scale training datasets and difficulty in structuring statistical models flexible enough to exploit document structure
Researches have been able to generate synthetic narratives and queries
It's really tough to capture the complexity and noise of natural language

Goal: Introduce a novel approach to building a supervised reading comprehension data set
